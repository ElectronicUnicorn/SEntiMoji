The size here is now just the size of the struct, hence the names (old/new) will not be a part of the dict.  Further, dict_set_bin, takes in a pointer, that it strores in the xattr/dict and later is freed when this dict is destroyed. In the case of passing a pointer which is a structure containing another pointer, the dict routines cannot encode this into the dict.  Overall, as info is passed to be stored as a dict, the above mechanism of allocating a pointer within info and passing this would fail to send these values across and also leak memory for the allocated info->buffer.	0.0	0.0

Cosmetic: According to last changes related to tvb_captured_length and tvb_reported_length it is good point to start thinking about "reported" case (btsnoop format provide both frame length). In "reported" case we can have only part of frame: for example first 2 bytes. This dissector will fail at this line, so nothing will be dissected, but if you move lines 131-140,(169)171-181 directly before place when it will be use then we can dissect some fields. "context" can be filled somewhere about line current 202, "rf_channel" can be put between lines 144-145, "aa_offenses" can be fetch after 170 or where "context" is filled, the problem is "flags", but after moved it after line 147 you are able to decode "btle_rf_channel" field etc.	0.0	0.0
I think it should be optimizerCtx.getLastStepFor(NAME)+1, since the methods which are last modified by DeadCodeElimination are deadcode-free.

changed to prefix operator++ (and further down in the code, too)  I had it mostly coded with date serial numbers, but had to make functions that are available for class Date.

since the spec says that the same format should be used for both critical options and extensions, I named the structures: optionsTuple, optionsTupleValue, and optionsTupleEmptyValue (I believe I needed the latter to marshal extensions with empty values where there is no double length prefix) - starting at Line 89 of certs.go.   I used them in the marshalTuples and parseTuples.  Regarding unmarshaling - please take a look at the current version, I wanted to use the same function for critical options and extensions, and to handle properly empty and non-empty values I believe some "low-level" handling is needed.

I remember seeing error like "Lproc: Attempting to register osc more than once" when trying to mount lustre file system on server node.

So if we have osp loaded before osc, we get the failure inserting osc module.  The error now gets hidden with this patch because lprocfs_seq_register() only warns about it and creates duplicated entry in parent's subdir link.

I guess this specifies whether the file is an xvg file? Then I would suggest introducing an enumerated type instead, both because we might have more file types to test in the future, and because it's is much more explicit with FileType_Xvg than true as the last parameter in calls to this function.  Alternatively, isn't it possible to decipher the filetype from the extension?	0.0	0.0
why do we json_encode() $scopeData here? We do not do this in the base class. Furthermore it is already serialized.  The only difference in this method compared to the one in the base class is now the Tree.thisScript stuff. The question therefore is: Is this a bug in the baseclass that Tree.thisScript is not set, or is it superfluous here? If neither applies, then still the question remains, if there's a nicer way of adding this code snippet without overriding (and copyiing) the complete method from the base class?	0.0	-1.0
In my opinion this function is not required. ArrayIndexItems function can return one more array called counts (count for each entry).

On HTTP /abandon and /restore accept no body. This results in null being passed to the apply() method, which handles it gracefully by creating an empty input.  I think its common to call /abandon and /restore with no input. Your tests are certainly showing that. Perhaps we should overload abandon() and restore() methods to also have a no-arg form that passes null to apply the same way the HTTP interface does when the client doesn't supply a body.	0.0	0.0
That's a bit of a philosophical discussion. I thought about it earlier, but the reason for limiting the range is that we only use the single precision range in the SIMD parts of Gromacs - since all algorithms in particular need to work if the user has set the precision to single - we only use double to improve precision, not range.  One _could_ of course add double precision range tests, but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for NaN, +-infinity, negative zero, etc? And, of course, not to mention - why we allow more than 1 ulp error :-)  For the error functions I actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smaller-than-double-precision-range, and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future. Thus, I like the idea of merely testing what we actually need, and if somebody comes up with a neat idea to improve that while only altering things we don't need, that should fundamentally be a good thing(TM)!	0.0	0.0

I swear I read somewhere on Smashing magazine along time ago that all pseudo selectors are less performant but I can't find such an article. I can only find these 2 references (not sure of there credibility): * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4082077/first-child-is-too-slow-alternatives/4082105#4082105 * http://www.onextrapixel.com/2012/05/03/css-tricks-how-to-speed-up-css-rendering/  I think the main thing I would say is whilst integrating with VE we should avoid them where possible. Use of first-child might invite us to use last-child and other selectors based on the idea. I do think we should be avoid nth-of-type and nth-child at all costs but I'd expect first-child and last-child to be less evil!  That said browsers are getting better and better these days and we could just make the decision that we will use them and wait for browsers and VE to catch up.  As tech lead, let me know what approach you want us to take. Happy either way. Please can we get the outcome documented on the coding guidelines page?	-1.0	0.0

I see your point, there is place for improving my original suggestion. The problem with your current code and new suggestion is: you don't respect visibility during the whole loop.

Example: if this code is merged as is or with your new suggestion, and you (you don't have +2 ACL on gerrit-review, right?) would open a change that belongs to a topic, that is shared by 1 million of changes, then you would iterate through all 1 mil. of changes, just to say visible = false, right?	0.0	-1.0

> I think it's cleaner. We do not have to re-implement and maintain different versions start-needed-srv in each script. Just one "vdsm_init_common.sh --start-needed-srv" to rule them all.  Here we disagree.  But we repeat our-selves... and not progressing, so we can stop doing that... and progress... as whatever we have now is much better than whatever existed before.  When a user/downstream maintainer opens the service/unit/script whatever he expects to actually understand what happens there and why, and not start to dig within application to find issues and modify downstream specific logic.  At upstart of have the start/stop convention (yeah... you need something for legacy sysv, but simple if is doing the work), for systemd you need nothing as it handles the dependencies, for openrc you need nothing as it handles the dependencies.  So the discussion is entirely around the sysv scripts... I do remember that debian does have dependency management based on the header of scripts[1]  So we left with rhel only to handle...

Patch Set 6: I would prefer that you didn't submit this  I like it, but it fails:  * A fatal is triggered if the _extensions table is empty (test: just truncate the table) * After update a refresh / reload should be done (or something), so the date is then current, or this should be handled by JS answer?	-1.0	-1.0
The three tests above that checks namespaces should probably grouped together. They seems to be copy pasted and just change which setting is gathered.  You could uses a dataProvider too. That will build an array of tests cases and pass the case to a test method.  Anyway, you should extract the foreach / assert in a new internal method such as assertNamespaceIsValid()	0.0	0.0
This is the line which triggers the crash.  createQmlObject() requires the calling context to be valid.  If this callback is invoked from C++ via the event loop, it has a chance to crash.  Note that using Damian's repro also uncovered a crash in QNetworkAccessFtpBackend::closeDownstreamChannel() which could hide the crash issue in QML, but that's a separate issue which needs to be tracked separately (the fix is trivial, just a null ptr check on the ftp ptr).	0.0	0.0

I've double checked the (REST) command i used to delete emails.  It wasn't a typo because I used the exact same command with an admin user and it worked just fine.

Trying to swap the layout when obj1 == obj2 should just "return 0" (i.e. be no-op).  There should also be a check that the two objects have the same uid and gid, and that the UID doing the swap is either owner or has mdd_capable(uc, CAP_FOWNER) since this would ensure the process isn't trying to steal data (i.e. the process doing this could read and overwrite the data if it wanted).	0.0	0.0

Not currently. It's somewhat different from what the current reference data approach uses, as I guess that you would want to generate that state using some code that is not part of the test (since if you can generate the state with code that runs anywhere, you do not really benefit from serialization).  Generic serialization is also a significant amount of code, even if straightforward (and with C++, it requires some careful thinking on what kind of constraints it enforces on the serializable types, unless you make the object itself responsible for the serialization).	-1.0	0.0
Right, changing an SwField, which is part of the document model during export is bad. An export operation should just read the document model and serialize it in some format. Can't you set m_bCitation depending on what the field type is? Just put a breakpoint on the SwField constructor, get a backtrace and see where it's created -- hopefully the caller knows the field type.	0.0	0.0
I assume this is something that's required if signature is not provided? If so; throw an exception here; or remove it completely from code.	0.0	0.0
