magnus, to write something along the lines of this is the number of sets of the most frequently written output type per frame set. the best default will need some experimentation. ideally this would be a user-configurable option, but it is not clear whether a (hidden) command-line option would be best (or env var), and not clear whether anybody would really use it in practice.

As of now, some caller assumes that the returned ref is not nil when the returned err is nil. When this assumption is not valid, as the original code shows, subsequent actions on the returned ref would cause NPE and lead to GOXDCR crashes, which caused the issue in MB-18266.   Returning a metadataNotFound err here is more correct conceptually, since this code is called from query APIs for remote cluster refs, and not being able to find the ref is an error condition. It will result in more consistent and predictable behavior -- the aforementioned issue will no longer occur.	0.0	0.0

Actually, it seems my comment isn't quite correct. Windows has strerror(3), and it behaves like you would expect... for the C library.  The Windows API calls essentially have their own errno that is retrieved by GetLastError(), and these error codes are not the same as those used by errno, and thus use the gross API (FormatMessage https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa908810.aspx) instead.

I don't think the comparison with the SshCommands (or RestViews) is fair. For SSH commands we have a simple lookup by command name and it is all that matters.  For project rename tasks it may be (and probably is) critical in which order the steps are executed. It is not just a set of tasks that can be done in any order. For a critical command as project rename the order of tasks execution should be explicit. At least it has to be documented. Right now, one has to look in the TaskModule, then in the DynamicSet and find out that, internally, it stores its items in a list which means that the iterator() will iterate in the order of the elements as they are in this list. And this is not even documented/guaranteed behavior of the DynamicSet.	-1.0	-1.0

Yes.  Actually, look at what I just merged to master with the query operators, in particular you might want to read the documentation in user-search.txt.  You can write a query to identify changes that can be submitted:    is:open CodeReview+2 Verified+1 -Verified-1 -CodeReview-2  If we put that string (minus the is:open part that would be implied) into your field, it means what you want it to mean... you can submit this only if the above expression is true.  By making it a single string, all you need to do is feed the string from the table through the ChangeQueryBuilder to get a Predicate<ChangeData>, and then run match() on that to see if the submit is possible.  That completely removes the FunctionState mess and starts to move us into this configurable submit logic that we have been discussing for quite a long time.  So the existence of that ChangeQueryBuilder and its Predicate support classes is why I was trying to steer you into a simple string here.  We have the code already done to handle that as a string, and users can use the same syntax to search for changes as they can for controlling how we manage them.	0.0	0.0

I thought a little about this. Basically it should work like this:  ImageName is null: there's no friendly name for the image, use the ImageId to list/display the image.  ImageName is not null: there's a friendly name specified for the image but since it can be duplicated (it's not guaranteed to be unique), then we should also give an hint about which image it is (at the moment that's done reporting the initial part of ImageId, just as git does with short hashes).  Now considering this last case if we set ImageName = ImageId, then the displayed name would be something like "myisoimagename.iso (myisoim)".  Please let me know if you have a better idea on how to handle this all.  Anyway (beside the image name displaying) I think that the safest way to address this now is not to set an ImageName since in fact there's not an additional friendly name to set.	0.0	0.0

I think it is, if you read the documentation of what's happening when there's already a conversion registered, the new conversion function is getting deleted, i.e. nothing will happen.

"with the transition to ORM all we should care of is the real identifiers of this class, which is id" Ã¢â‚¬â€ that's considered to be not true. Since we(at least I don't) do not know (yet?), which operations will be performed on entities, we cannot tell, what we have to compare. Namely, we have to know first, whether these entities will be processed also with unset id when stored in collections, if so, then comparing just ids spells crazy results. Usually it's recommended to compare some unique business id instead of or along with db ID. See Hibernate recommendation related to id generation / object identity.  Ok, I'll regenerate equals&hashcode using these two fields.  Note: this syntax is Java7 syntax, with direct field access, allowing comparing classes with their descendants (the last thing is necessary due to hibernate design).	-1.0	-1.0

s/exit/continue/  Exiting the loop doesn't do a final update of v. The write to conflict with this read must happen during the setup for a subsequent iteration.   This one does bother me. To be clear, what's going on is:  v = a[0] go func() { x = v }() v = a[1] go func() { y = v }()  There is no race involving the second goroutine, since its read is guaranteed to happen after the write of v = a[1]. The race is between the x = v and the v = a[1]. I don't understand why the race detector does not detect that misordering 100% of the time. I filed #10589 about this. At least this fixes the build so that we can detect future breakages while Dmitriy thinks about this one.	-1.0	-1.0

FYI this probably doesn't always work. Booleans are stored as CHAR(1) with value Y for true and N for false. Not every JDBC driver out is going to grok this as a boolean value. It would be safer to use "Y".equals(rs.getString()) in code such as this.  Can't this statement also be written as an UPDATE:    UPDATE accounts SET reverse_patch_set_order = 'Y'   WHERE display_patch_sets_in_reverse_order = 'Y';    UPDATE accounts SET show_username_in_review_category = 'Y'   WHERE display_person_name_in_review_category = 'Y';  This should be much faster to process, and every SQL server we support will grok those two small statements. And it avoids the problem with boolean conversion.	-1.0	-1.0

I started replacing C0 with c[0] because I didn't see a significant advantage of having C0 available. But then I saw this and realized this AI naming is used in some other places. And it might be helpful to have the I..M index. I thought about creating an enum to define I to M (to use as a[I]) but of course I to M would be by itself bad names which conflict easily with other things. And I thought it would be nice to have C and A by consistent. So I also created CO..C2 not just AI..AM.

In which case, shouldn't the code just say that all other open projects should already have their SDK's pointing to the SDK used by the IDE?  i.e., now that we do this, we shouldn't have to modify other projects, only this project since all others should already be in sync.  The fishy part here is just that choosing something in a project import dialog affects other projects which doesn't make sense.

I still think you also need to check that the $bi->get('blocktype') is allowed for $artefacttype->name.

So we need to check not just if the plugin is correct (eg = 'file') but that the artefacttype is of the correct subset for the block (eg 'audio, video') for the block instance (eg 'internalmedia')	0.0	0.0

Patch Set 1:  Thanks for your reviews.  To be honest, it would be nice, if you could be a bit more friendly to - not first time in case of Thomas, but occasional - contributors. IMHO one or two -1 are enough for the beginning.  Bjrn and Philipp, you're really helpful contributors, thanks for that. We were discussing the "patch for a patch rule" over the last days, which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago (and it works in at least most of the cases I think).  Please don't treat this as harsh words, I just want to make you aware of the fact that motivating every new contributor is very important for us, and hopefully also for you as an essential part of the TYPO3 community.

Hi Nigel,  To expand on what Tobias said, when you change the content of a language string you also need to change its name. Otherwise the Launchpad translation site isn't smart enough to tell translators that they need to update it. See https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Developer_Area/Language_strings#Let_translators_know_when_lang_strings_change  So please change the string name to "editaccesspagedescription4". You'll also need to change the name of the string in the PHP files and templates where it is used.  Sorry about that!  Cheers, Aaron	0.0	0.0
unused parameter 'p_info' [-Werror=unused-parameter]   (p_info ? -> pinfo ?)	0.0	0.0
It is a logical change, but it is correct!  $configuration['vendorName'] !== NULL  triggers a PHP notice, when $configuration['vendorName'] is not set	0.0	0.0
Thanks a lot for your review. What do you think about "in the adapted class"?  Anyway, I'm going to bother some of the guru to hear what they think about it...	0.0	0.0
How is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of _xlfn.CEILING.MATH ? I think that's missing.  Note that now that we use RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler, the tables in sc/source/filter/oox/formulabase.cxx are only provided for API support (of which we actually don't know if anyone is using it at all). Our internal OOXML import/export doesn't use them anymore, so any "only for import / only for export" usage needs to be implemented differently.	-1.0	0.0
Please don't. See my comment in utils.py. Configure the logger with proper formatter instead.	-1.0	-1.0
I have been told in the past some compilers don't initialize all elements to 0 with 'foo[n]={0};' - I've never found such a compiler, so maybe it's an urban legend. :)  memset() yup shoulda done that. Ironically I looked for a memset equivalent in glib, so I don't know why I didn't use it.	-1.0	0.0
These are good, but I think we need another test which exercises the untested path in fault.py. Otherwise, if it is in fact unreachable, we need to eliminate that code path.	0.0	0.0
mh yeah will be removed with next push...	0.0	0.0
