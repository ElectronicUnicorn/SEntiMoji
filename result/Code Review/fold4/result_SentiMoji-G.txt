Josh, my proposal is to see boot as a helper for deploy driver (or to any other interface or anyone else) rather than to see it as a separate interface.   Boot should just take care of getting the bare metal booted to the required environment - whether for ironic to perform an operation OR to boot the user-requested image.    Thinking in these lines, I would think boot interface should refrain from participating in cleaning.  Boot interface should participate in cleaning only if it had something to clean up on the bare metal node that would take a lot of time - in my mind there isn't anything.  We can discuss in the IRC.	0.0	0.0

Is this the right API? An alternative is:  func If(s RuneSet, tTrue, tFalse Transformer) Transformer  type RuneSet interface {   Contains(rune) bool }  and have unicode.RangeTable implement this interface.  If performance is a concern, the If function could do a type assertion to see if s is a *unicode.RangeTable, and switch to an optimized implementation, the same way that the image/draw package does in the stdlib.  But I'm not sure if we even want a Ranges or If. The point of the Transformer interface is to transform things in bulk. If you're going to be chopping between two separate transformers depending on the input runes, then it seems like you're not getting the benefit of transforming in bulk. Instead, I'd just loop over the input and append to a []byte. It's not like you have some input that contains both Code Page 437 and Shift-JIS and you want to switch between them. Your phone number Ranges example seems a bit contrived, and again, I'd just for/range over the string for that particular task.

If you want varargs, you could add an addAll() method:   HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();  hrc.addAll(hr1, hr2);  or with a Collection or Iterable as argument:   HandlerRegistrationCollection hrc = new HandlerRegistrationCollection();  hrc.addAll(Arrays.asList(hr1, hr2));  Note that Sencha has not felt the need to add such collection/varargs to their GroupingHandlerRegistration: http://docs.sencha.com/gxt/3/com/sencha/gxt/core/shared/event/GroupingHandlerRegistration.html  Similar for GWT-P's registerHandler on their PresenterWidget base class: http://arcbees.github.io/GWTP/javadoc/apidocs/com/gwtplatform/mvp/client/HandlerContainerImpl.html#registerHandler(com.google.web.bindery.event.shared.HandlerRegistration)	0.0	0.0

It's a good idea to make all GAVs used  in test projects specific to the IT that is being run to avoid unwanted crosstalk/side-effects between unrelated ITs, esp. when they are being run in parallel.

We would prefer to keep this.  It is possible for the RILD and radio code to pass the sequence number through into radio state as the request is being acted on - the RILD may notice the socket error and re-establish the connection and then the response comes back from the radio with the old sequence number and get's passed back through the newly-connected RILD.  Just because your implementation may not do this, we can imagine other OEMs passing back obsolete responses that would match a newly-zero'd RIL sequence number and confuse things.  Couldn't you just remember the first sequence number your RILD connection received?  Then you know the number of requests you've received.	0.0	-1.0

This is more obvious in this file than the other. You should be escaping the periods in your regular expressions. I know that it will match the period in the URL anyway, but we want it to *only* match the period.  Also, you should use specific matches for scid, height and width, rather than the period (match anything). Assuming that you're just matching numbers, '[0-9]+', or tentatively '\d+' would be better here.  One more thing, if these sites provide copy-and-paste embed tags, these matches will need to be able to deal with those too - currently they look like they will just modify the URL in-place, and this is definitely not what we want.	0.0	-1.0

Looking at all *Listener.java files in our source tree I see the following two cases:  * a listener is just notified that an event happened but cannot do anything to prevent/block that event. In that case the listener doesn't throw any checked exception(s). Examples: GitReferenceUpdatedListener, HeadUpdatedListener, AuditListener, ...  * a listener can block the event. In this case the listener throws a checked exception which is on the same level of abstraction as the listener interface. Examples: CommitValidationListener throws CommitValidationException, MergeValidationListener throws MergeValidationException, ...  Since this listener is not intended to validate/block a group membership change(s) it belongs to the first category and shouldn't throw any exception.	0.0	0.0

Here, we are making a bunch of datastore calls in a loop, which could fail (or time out) and drop half of the updates.  Since this is derived data and an async update is probably okay, a more robust approach would be to put tasks on the App Engine task queue to refresh each graph. Failed tasks automatically get retried.  The most robust way to do the update: given a graph id, regenerate the graph from a query of all its dependencies, sort of like a makefile. Then, since it's idempotent, it doesn't matter if it fails sometimes, and we can ignore concurrency as well since multiple writes don't matter.  (Incremental updates would be more efficient but trickier to get right, so I typically put that off until it seems necessary.)	0.0	0.0

Ah, ok. Let me explain a bit: The USBIP server/client is split into two parts. On the server side, there's an userspace daemon (usbipd) and a kernel module usbip-host.ko. The client has a userspace tool (usbip) and a virtual usb hcd vhci-hcd.ko.   So, get_usbip_message_len is split in the same manner.  The Device List, Import, .... Request/Response stuff (which has a protocl version 0x111) is the user space portion. The usbip-host.ko and vhci-hcd.ko part (aka URBs handling, version = 0x0000) is part of the kernel. You are right, I'll add comment which explains why the function got so convoluted.	0.0	0.0
Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this  This bug is a duplicate 841534 of and will be handled in http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/6593.  After discussing, the correct behavior is to allow diskless templates, so this patch is no longer relevant. Please abandon it.   Sorry for the hassle.	0.0	-1.0
Use tvb_ip_to_str.  That should eliminate the need for arpa/inet.h	0.0	0.0
I personally hate this! commands should not go to a redirected file. I think your redirect options should be off, on, verbose - and only verbose should add commands	0.0	-1.0
How is 'bbox' supposed to be encoded for transmission over http?  Currently its encoded as a Javascript array, which is probably why its not behaving as expected.	-1.0	-1.0
Please explain on why it is been taken out from the switch case below.	-1.0	0.0
Add newline.  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------	0.0	0.0
I'm not really liking this name, maybe just 'Resources'?	-1.0	-1.0
We can address it in a separate commit, but I rather use only one approach for the compaction instead of having a sorted compaction as an option. Sorting will be expensive especially when we have a large number of items. If we don't have not much performance gain, I rather use an unsorted option.	0.0	0.0
I wonder why jetbrains repeats this code in all their bundles.	0.0	-1.0
Sounds good to me. I shall handle these changes in the separate patch. Thanks!	0.0	0.0
This isn't a very good function name.. (I assume that it doesn't initialize everything in memcached).. init_allocation_hooks() would probably be a better name..	0.0	-1.0
I agree that we should follow master for this and projects like CTK, but it is better explicitly update sha with commits.  Otherwise, upstream can update at any point and builds or tests will mysteriously start failing.  Also, when checking out branches or tags, we will get the versions of CTK, etc that are known to work with that branch/tag of TubeTK.	0.0	0.0
Please document these. is_precise is we know the exact type? Would 'exact' be clearer?	0.0	0.0
I now believe that all paths have already done a finishsweep by this point so removing this as you did is correct.	0.0	0.0
s/logical//  (logical as opposed to what? it's all logical in software... - leave away)  how about:  Loading is controlled by this dependency graph.	0.0	-1.0
i think you can use here getAndSetVdsStatic() to get the vds name, so we will have it in the log, i think it is called anyway for the logging infrastructure ("FINISH")	0.0	0.0
what's the purpose of this change? do we really need this in the patch?	0.0	-1.0
This is a weird format. It won't close twice actually, and it's not to handle the exception. There is an infinite loop from L1537 to L1581. In each iteration, it opens the zipfile. Before getting into another iteration, it needs to close the zipfile... I've moved L1583 inside the loop to make it less weird.	0.0	-1.0
:(  So we need to either port this file over to kernel style or not use goto's.  Since we started it before everyone decided kernel style was OK, we've been using a hacked-down google c++ style which forbids goto :/	0.0	-1.0
Adding to Megumi's nit: Consider initializing the value to true, and possibly collapsing these two methods down to one with an argument	0.0	0.0
