Deleting files in Xcode does not delete them from installed apps/build folders/etc. It's extremely annoying. If you really want your app to only run in 3.5 inch mode, delete the Default-568 file and make sure to run Clean/Clean Build Folder in Xcode, and delete the app completely off your simulator/device. It should start showing up letterboxed again. Apple is still accepting 3.5in only submissions.	negative	negative

The reason to build it into the language is that it can get painful when you want a hierarchy of chainable objects that return the most derived type. Currently, you have to have `` generics to allow subclasses to change the return type so calling methods don't lose scope of the object they are calling. Building into the jvm removes this ugliness. Plus, instead of a return statement, it can just push a reference to this on the stack as needed; an "on demand return" instead of an "always return" that can be hard to optimize out when you don't use it.	negative	neutral

Why use a `Mutex` here? The `Acquire` method just returns a reference to an instance (this is a reference type). Whether the object referenced is mutable or immutable is irrelevant. The reference is to the same object no matter if the object mutates. Why do locking? Even if the instance was not "singleton" or "read-only", i.e. even if the field reference could change, since [reference assignments are atomic](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5209623/), there would still be no need for locking/`Mutex`.

I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.	neutral	negative

MySQL is extremely cheap when you have the distro (or staff to build) that carries MySQL Enterprise edition. This is a High Availability version which offers multi-master replication over many servers. Pros are low (license-) costs after initial purchase of hardware (Gigs of RAM needed!) and time to set up. The drawbacks are suboptimal performance with many joins, no full-text indexing, stored procesures (I think) and one need to replicate grants to every master node. Yet it's easier to run than the replication/proxy balancing setup that's available for PostgreSQL.	neutral	neutral

The length of a Python Unicode string in a narrow-Unicode build is the number of UTF-16 *code units*, not actual Unicode code points. Truncating and other slicing options that go by arbitrary index can indeed split a surrogate pair in half, with the result of some missing/replaced characters. On a narrow build, `unichr(0x10345)` simply fails; `len(u'\U00010345')` is `2`. This is the price you pay for easy interaction with Win32 UTF-16LE APIs. Most other environments use UCS-4 which doesn't suffer from any such problem.	neutral	neutral

I assume you're using Ken Reitz's excellent requests library to do the HTTP requests (if not, you really should be!)Most likely, the problem is that requests doesn't add a 'Content-type' header to multi-part uploads, and packmgr doesn't read multi-part bodies with no 'Content-type' header. So, while a normal 'requests' POST of a multipart-encoded file would go something like this: you instead have to use the longer form, setting an explicit content-type: Note that one side-effect of doing it this way is that it cannot stream the file - the entire package ZIP file will be read into memory.	neutral	neutral

While your basic point is correct, the code you've shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question: Afaik, you get four `int` in one cache line, that means on average you get a latency of less than 30 cycles to load the data (not considering prefetching), you have conditional jumps in your loop (modern architectures hate mispredicting those), so you get much, much more than a cycle for each loop iteration.

I wouldn't class that a problem. If you structure things in a meaningful way, you should be able to look at the JS, see where all the event hooks are. If you're worried too much about it, you *could* set the rel attr to js, or prepent the ID with js_, etc.	neutral	neutral

Its not quick to do, but you can also run FXCop, and it will alert you to objects that are IDisposable that arent in a using() block.
