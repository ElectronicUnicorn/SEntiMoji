I understand you do this so that GF_FREE() under the out: label does not free the acl_xattr. The dict_unref() will call GF_FREE() already.  Is there a need for GF_FREE() in out: at all?

There is no need for this 'acl_xattr   NULL' then anymore.  If you do not like that approach (or if I missed something that makes it impractical), this 'acl_xattr   NULL' stetment desperately needs a comment.	-1.0	-1.0

But then there's no need to re-define the gwt-maven-plugin's dependencies. So either we use  {gwtVersion} as the gwt-maven-plugin version and we remove the plugin dependencies, or we keep it that way, with identical but "unrelated" versions for GWT and the gwt-maven-plugin.  I'd happily go with the former (which would simplify the POM and aligns with what people should write unless they really need different versions of GWT and the plugin Ã â‚ â œ e.g. they use a patched GWT, or a patched plugin, or the plugin hasn't yet been released for the version of GWT they want to use, or the plugin has had a bugfix release), but it makes it a bit harder to test the WebAppCreator with a GWT RC (not yet pushed to Central), where the plugin hasn't yet been released (because it cannot update its GWT dependencies yet).

Patch Set 2:  Liron, so lets think: Reconstruct flow: Go throught all vds refresh and on case of some exception connect.

That was actually the original code. If dest    src and you're only copying one byte at a time, if you start from the top you'll never overwrite the data you haven't copied yet. Otherwise, you have to start from the other end. *dest     *src memcpy;, but memcpy is not *dest     *src;.  To quote from the pretty short man page:  The memory areas must not overlap.  That's the difference between memcpy and memmove. If there was no overlap at all (which we could check for) then you could use memcpy, and that would make the normal case work like it always has.  But I'm working on a change to add optimized versions of memmove for x86 and ARM. In order to test them I'm going to implement them in the chromeos tree, and then to transfer them over I've put together a big series of patches to upstream so they should just apply.	0.0	0.0

Conversion was done for binary files to be stored in earlier formats.

If you want you can remove that code in a follow-up patch, getting rid of unused code is always good :-)  Probably the reason why you had to add the check if a version is set at all is related to that, actually the stream should have the version SOFFICE_FILEFORMAT_CURRENT set so all parts involved elsewhere that do check the version get that correct.

Patch Set 4:  Although already merged, I don't think this is the right solution.   Currently the behavior of the permissions system (TCEmain and thus also all other components) is to use "checkLanguageAccess" only if the TCA for the table has a "languageField".  "pages" is not such a table, because there is "pages_language_overlay". So the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the "Original Language" is to remove the permissions for editing table "pages" and only allow "pages_language_overlay". See also http://forge.typo3.org/issues/27794  This is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checkLanguageAccess.  Similar problem we have in the "List view", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. Permission check in TCEmain is more "aggressive" than in the GUI.  Correct solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has "edit permissions" on the "pages" table - just like TCEmain also does.  As this is confusing for integrators in general, I would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on "language restriction permissions on pages" in the first place before fixing the GUI.  I am undecided still if we should revert this merge, but I am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to 4.5.  Maybe in your research you find out different aspects than I did or you can prove me wrong as I have only touched the "surface" of the whole complex. Please let me know!	0.0	-1.0

Yes, it is a bug in adb, no ambiguity here, but it's really subtle, so it'd be nice to have a better description of the problem, it's not really Python specific as you mention, i.e. something like:  """ Some programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling CreateProcess with inheritable stdout/stderr handles, then using read() to get its output. When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable.  When starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.  Otherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they're connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them). """  The PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST isn't directly related to the problem, and not needed in this specific case because I don't think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process (at least when reaching this code). It's probably better to avoid mentioning it, or add a note like "ideally, use PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST if running on Vista or higher"	0.0	0.0

Since we don't want this dependency I don't know how to implement it.  On the other hand, if you have SSH enabled and you are interested in the SSH summary and connections you can retrieve this information via SSH. The REST endpoints are mainly important for installations where SSH is not available, but in this case there is also no SSH summary and no SSH connections. This is why I'm okay with the current solution of ignoring the SSH stuff in the REST endpoint.	0.0	0.0

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this  (2 inline comments)  I don't see the need for this change. If you built with the ebuild unmodified, you'd get an image.bin which would be what you want. As far as I could tell looking at the new function, it's identical to the old one except that you're leaving out the original image.bin.  The difference between image.bin and image.rw.bin is that cros_bundle_firmware is being passed the --force-rw option in one case and not in the other. What that does is it changes the way parts of the image are put together so that vboot doesn't allow the RO only optimization even if the RO firmware claims it supports it.  The RO only optimization is where you run the whole firmware out of RO instead of jumping into an RW copy partway through. If you really don't want to enable that optimization, you can not pass that flag to vboot when running VbInit.  Even if you do want to split things out like this, it would be better to take the existing depthcharge function and to selectively build the RO image based on a use flag.   Independent of whether splitting things up is a good idea, if Mike (who knows bash much better than I do, I think) likes the style of the new function you've made, it would be nice to incorporate the style changes back into the original function.	0.0	-1.0

I'm still trying to understand what this new logic brings to the table...after all of this effort, we are still just enforcing that the project/tenant-id that created an entity (secret/order) is the same one that can perform operations on that entity.

If we were doing attribute-level access control, it might make more sense to me, but entity level for tenant-id RBAC is redundant to the db queries to me.	-1.0	-1.0

When you move a host to maintenance then that calls disconnectStorageServer which should remove this definition so in general this shouldn't affect anything negatively.  The case where this would remain is in case of an error flow where for some reason it wasn't disconnected properly or something.  Even if that happens, it's not that interesting as a few leftover connections shouldn't affect the host negatively (think about FC where the host is always connected). The advantage is that most of the time (since hosts don't move between DCs very often) the host would automatically reconnect whenever it reboots (e.g. due to sanlock fencing) and it would be available to engine almost immediately reducing recovery time.  Imo that is more important. See oVirt Bug 881941 - After a reboot of both engine and vdsm domains take a long time (15 minutes) to recover	-1.0	0.0

I like calling *somewhere* rather than inline policy-conditional code.

But backed off because there would be a slight loss of optimisation because as it stands, the loop is never executed if there is *no* newest file.  I guess a call to a policy.get_newest(file_set) would do it.

We need to enter in this IF block only in case of unknown protocol, so when dissector_try_heuristic() return value is 0.	0.0	0.0
I think the expert info should point to the end_marker field itself (replace "message_tree" with "tiem").	0.0	0.0
xport entries are added to the conf- xprt_list under the "conf- mutex",  but not client entries.  "xprt" entries are added to the list during handshake I suppose in server_rpc_notify(). Post that , in "server_setvolume()", we create client entry and assign it to transport object "xprt". So there could be scenarios where in we have an entry in xprt_list without client associated.	0.0	0.0

I understand that right not only root is supported by engine, but I prefer that the API layer will pass to the engine all the information that the user provided. Engine may choose to ignore, for now, all users aside for 'root'.   The way it's written here, is just a bug waiting to happen - tomorrow engine will support other users, and suddenly we will have a bug in the API: some users are not passed on to the engine, for some reason.	0.0	-1.0
Is the model about logs (as the class name suggests) or about log rows (as the parameter name suggests)? At least one of them needs to be changed.	0.0	0.0

Damn it, that wasn't supposed to be there. I'll remove it.	-1.0	-1.0
So at very least you should only check/parse patch set part, if ref starts with REFS_CHANGES, if at all.  It already does this, startIndex checks for the prefix.	0.0	0.0

Before the goto, you must update errcode. What happens now is that we fall to alloc_error label and then return a success status when actually an error happened and *dst was not populated.	0.0	0.0

Hmm notification sounds like a QObject::signals, I'd say that's somewhat misleading. So I'd name that with something indicating the progress Bar.	0.0	-1.0
Along the same vein of getting the class's METADATA_TYPE when deserializing the response, since you are checking if the METADATA_TYPE is located in the json_dict, you could reference the class's METADATA_TYPE directly.  (I should have seen this in the last code review)    if DriverInfo.METADATA_TYPE in json_dict:        body   The same applies for the properties keyword check in line 67.	0.0	0.0
But you are already the NAT gateway (in 1) so no one else should be using gateway address?  Anyway I'm fine with -3 : please just add a comment to explain why it's -3 :)	0.0	0.0

Sorry. I did not closely looked into log date part. Thanks for this patch	0.0	0.0
I don't believe so.  I was using it, but because we have messages that can be one byte long (such as a keepalive) and some messages that require as much as 32 bytes to determine others I needed something more flexible.	0.0	-1.0
