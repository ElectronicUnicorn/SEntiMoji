Well, this may not be very graceful... but you can retrieve the current focused control pretty easily.

With no offense, just as one developer to another, I'm afraid that your idea seems terribly inefficient. It seems to me that instead of uniting SQLite databases you should probably be storing several tables within the same Database file. However if I'm mistaken I guess you could ATTACH the databases and then use a VIEW to simplify your queries. Or make an in-memory table and copy over all the data (but that's even worse performance wise, especially if you have large databases)	0	0
Agree that you should ensure that your data is properly indexed. Apart from that, if you are worried about table size, you can always implement some type of data archival strategy to later down the line. Don't worry too much about this until you see problems cropping up, and don't optimise prematurely.	0	1

You should prepare your statement only once, outside of the loop, and then bind the parameters in the loop.

I can only repeat what others have said. Parametrized SQL is the way to go. Sure, it is a bit of a pain in the butt coding it - but once you have done it once, then it isn't difficult to cut and paste that code, and making the modifications you need. We have a lot of .Net applications that allow web site visitors specify a whole range of search criteria, and the code builds the SQL Select statement on the fly - but everything that could have been entered by a user goes into a parameter.	0	1

First: I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application.Excellent! But, as you said: Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.	0	0

To generate my private pgp key: To encrypt I'd give my shared key to a friend: To decrypt the encrypted string after being sent back to me: Obviously I know I'm skipping out on a ton of details.

I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.	0	0

The length of a Python Unicode string in a narrow-Unicode build is the number of UTF-16 *code units*, not actual Unicode code points. Truncating and other slicing options that go by arbitrary index can indeed split a surrogate pair in half, with the result of some missing/replaced characters. On a narrow build, `unichr(0x10345)` simply fails; `len(u'\U00010345')` is `2`. This is the price you pay for easy interaction with Win32 UTF-16LE APIs. Most other environments use UCS-4 which doesn't suffer from any such problem.	0	0

If you're really worried about string/character size, have you thought about compressing them? That would automatically reduce the string to it's 'minimal' encoding.

It comes down to 'designing for testability'. Ideally, you should not instantiate those COM objects directly but should access them through a layer of indirection that can be replaced by a mock object.

Android apps are constrained to a certain amount of memory. As it's quite (insanely?) low, I think you shouldn't feel guilty about using all of it! The limit is 16 MB on very old devices, 24 MB or 32 MB on newer ones. There doesn't seem to be much info on the size for different devices, and nobody seems to know why the limit is so small when modern phones have 1-2 GB of RAM. Aha, I found some concrete numbers on the limit: G1: 16MB Droid: 24MB Nexus One: 32MB Xoom: 48MB	0	0

The class in Java has only two data members, a reference to an array and a sizeâ€”which you need anyway if you don't use an . So the only advantage to not using an is saving one object allocation, which is unlikely ever to be a big deal. If you're creating and disposing of many, many instances of your container class (and by extension your instance) every second, you might have a slight problem with garbage collection churnâ€”but that's something to worry about if it ever occurs. Garbage collection is typically the least of your worries.	0	0
A database is meant to manage large volumes of data, and are supposed to give you fast access to read and write that data in spite of the size. Put simply, they manage scale for data - scale that you don't want to deal with. If you have only a few users (hundreds?), you could just as easily manage the data on disk (say XML?) and keep the data in memory. The images should clearly not go in to the database so the question is how much data, or for how many users are you maintaining this database instance?	0	0

It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program's design more precise.Next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as . After having done this you can use .Here's how: Be warned that it's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs, but this option won't hurt much if you're just trying to disable a function. By the way, this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it, it's now up to you to choose which method will receive this. Hope this was helpful!	0	1

I've been tasked with seeting up a search service on an eCommerce site. Currently, it uses full text indexing on sql server, which isn't ideal, as it's slow, and not all that flexible. How would you suggest i approach changing this over to lucene? By that, i mean, how would i initially load all the data into the indexes, and how would it be maintained? on my "insert product" methods, would i also have it insert it into the index? any information is of great help!	0	0

Ryan Oberoi makes an excellent suggestion, but it's a bit overkill for my small ASP.NET MVC web application.

I guess I should select Ryan's response as the solution as it would probably help others more... any suggestions?	0	0

We have a file named wordlist, which contains 1,876 KB worth of alphabetized words, all of which are longer than 4 letters and contain one carriage return between each new two-letter construction (ab, ac, ad, etc., words all contain returns between them): I want to create a new file that contains only words that are not derivatives of other, smaller words. For example, the wordlist contains the following words ["abuser, abused, abusers, abuse, abuses, etc.] The new file that is created should retain only the word "abuse" because it is the "lowest common denominator" (if you will) between all those words. Similarly, the word "rodeo" would be removed because it contains the word rode. I tried this implementation: But it always froze my computer. Any solutions?	0	0
FlexMonkey may be more of a pain than it is worth. Gorrilla Logic claims it works with custom components but I have found this is not the case.

I have written tests for one component 5 times now using hardcoded ids. Sometimes it just can't see the component and it dies.

At a guess, you're probably defining your objects in VB as just s, something like this: If so, you're forcing VB to go through the automation interface (IDispatch). Basically, it doesn't know what type you're going to assign to until run-time, so it has to invoke methods on that object via IDispatch::Invoke. To do that, it looks up all the information it needs for an invocation from the object itself at run time.By contrast, your C++ code is probably early-bound, which means offsets into the COM object's vtable are compiled directly into your code. In that case, when/if you change the code so those offsets aren't valid any more, the code will fail horribly.	0	0

The method in .NET returns a by-ref version of a type, e.g. passing the type of returns a type representing . However, if you already have a , what is the mechanism for obtaining a plain old ? There doesn't seem to be an opposite method to remove the by-ref modifier. At the moment I've put a hack in place which re-builds the assembly-qualified name without an at the end of the type name and then loads that type, but this is horribly dirty...	0	0
Reviewing the MSDN docs for the functions listed , I see that the function checks with the SMBIOS table, which is referenced by a standard It appears that you indeed can find the information you seek through the BIOS.

Suggest adding the following to Peek and Pop(): if ((_stack.Count - 1) < 0) throw new Exception("Cannot Peek or Pop without first doing a Push.");. This would alert the programmer to this corner case, and allow them to keep it in mind when using this class. We could also add a TryPeek or TryPop, which is the approach Microsoft have taken with their ConcurrentDictionary implementations.	0	0

I'm sure your database does not care how you're performing the `lexical_cast`. If your database does not support Unicode, get a real database.

I'm receiving a recovery feed from an exchange for recovering data missed from their primary feed.

My goal is to write a cookie when the user authenticates. We are using a crappy framework that hides its source code and event model so when I use their login control I can't set a session timeout on it!

Consider this HTML: On all browsers but Firefox/Mac, it renders correctly, i.e bold and non-bold text are on the same baseline.

If you can edit the code, you should just re-write it to use a custom API that does what you want. Failing that, use Maximilian's technique, but be warned that it is a maintenance horror. If you cannot edit the code, you can patch the import tables to redirect calls to your own code. A description of this technique can be found in - search for the section titled "Spying by altering of the Import Address Table". This is dangerous, but if you're careful you can make it work. Also check out , which does the same sort of thing but doesn't require you to mess around with the actual patching.	0	0

Yeah - my solution to this was to limit IE users - they can only select a tiny subset of the rows and columns that FX and Chrome users can. Even then IE8 only just copes with maybe 25 cells (5x5 grid), 7 and 6 remain hopeless.

I only have one important piece of advice - make absolutely sure you can revert back to the state before you started the refactor without losing anything. Then just dive in and go for it. You may well end up having to stop and start again, but that's nothing to be afraid of (as long as you heeded my one piece of advice). You'll learn a lot doing it.	0	0

Entering "udp://host:666" in the location bar doesn't work very well. Is there any work-around for sending a single "empty" datagram to a host using an ordinary web browser?

Regarding selling agile, one angle of approach is proposing agile techniques as a way of reducing the "project crunch". By this I mean the overwhelming list of deferred issues, "99% complete" code and oversights that accumulate towards the end of the project. This normally causes a lot of stress and compromises in order to meet the deadline. If a development organisation has never experienced project crunch, it would be a big surprise to me. Therefore I think this is a neat way of locking into a some shared pain and suggesting agile techniques as a load-levelling technique should provoke some interest that can lead onto a more complete discussion of the methodology(s).	0	0
