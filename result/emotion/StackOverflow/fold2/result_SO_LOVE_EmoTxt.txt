If you're really worried about string/character size, have you thought about compressing them? That would automatically reduce the string to it's 'minimal' encoding.

I need to write some code that will buffer a line to create a polygon as shown below. From following the steps outlined, I can create polygon shapes around simple lines that do not cross themselves or have too tight curves, but as the lines I'm trying to buffer are squiggly swhirly hurricane tracks, it's really not good enough.

While your basic point is correct, the code you've shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question: Afaik, you get four `int` in one cache line, that means on average you get a latency of less than 30 cycles to load the data (not considering prefetching), you have conditional jumps in your loop (modern architectures hate mispredicting those), so you get much, much more than a cycle for each loop iteration. I'd wager, your swap will take at least 100 to 200 cycles, probably more, but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping (how many mispredictions are made).	0	0

The function signature for pthread_create requires a function that returns . Also, returned from should be treated opaquely. Both of these changes are reflected below and compile on my machine: UPDATE: There are some other issues with your program as well.

I have just about finished adding all of the content to each page of my website. I've noticed, however, when I navigate between links some of the pages shift to the right about 10 px or so. This is extremely irritating. All of my pages are contained within the same container using a fluid grid. However, not all pages have the same amount of content. I noticed that pages with empty divs don't shift when I navigate between them. However, if I navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content, I see the shift. Should this be happening if all of my pages are using the same container, same fluid grid? Does this make sense? Can you sense my desperation?	0	0

My guess is that you would have to extend the classes for DataTip, to check for NULL hitData objects, to kill/stop the drawing of the display. I do not think there is a way to do that normally in FLEX. You would have to customize and override the hitData class unfortunately. What a pain!!	0	0

In the absence of tuples, they're sometimes the cleanest way to do things. I generally hate them, though. F# has some nice syntactical sugar for dealing with them.

Is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user's font size preference? And if there isn't, how would you suggest that I go about calculating the font sizes?

First: I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application.Excellent! But, as you said: Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.	0	1

I'm pretty sure I never said "excellent abstraction". It's not meant to hide the details of the Win32 API, it's meant to provide a means to develop applications that use the Win32 API faster, and more uniformly, while still making it easy to call directly into the Win32 API when necessary or convenient. At that, it is excellent.	0	0

There are many libraries that make cross-platform development easier on their own, but making a complete wrapper for all platforms ends up being either small and highly customized, or massive and completely ridiculous.

I think that's absolutely terrible practice. First of all you do not need to make the trip to the server to hide and show controls, unless you need new data. Second, any decent javascript framework will allow you to hide show controls based on the control's id, class name, or whatever css selector. Moreover using a javascript post/get to a generic handler will give you the data that you need without the postback. I'd suggest using JQuery, or some other alternative.	0	0

I think your best bet is to drop the idea of wrapping the array in a structure, bite the bullet and allocate a 2D array yourself.This will mean that you need to do explicit indexing, but that would have to happen under the hood anyway.When it comes to alignment, if you're going to visit every array elements in each of the arrays, it probably doesn't matter, it's better to make them compact to maximize use of cache.Something like: Then to index, just do: If you're very worried about that multiplication, use a temporary pointer. After profiling it, of course.Sometimes you see this done with a helper macro to do the indexing: then you can write the final line as: it's a bit clumsy since the needs to go in there all the time, of course.	0	0

To save you some time, look to other solutions.I'm working on this exact task now, but I'm about to give up due to Cloud SQL's very poor performance. It might work fine for websites like Orane's, but for larger more complex websites the high latency and slow response time from Cloud SQL means for us 3 second load times instead of 0.7s that we have on our VPS. I have tested by connecting to both IP and Socket, SSL and without, and it's just not usable as-is. If you test with Amazon RDS, the difference in speed is shocking.The only other solution we've been able to come up with is to set up an API server that continously caches data to memcache and only serve static pages on App Engine with most dynamic content loading through AJAX.

The length of a Python Unicode string in a narrow-Unicode build is the number of UTF-16 *code units*, not actual Unicode code points. Truncating and other slicing options that go by arbitrary index can indeed split a surrogate pair in half, with the result of some missing/replaced characters. On a narrow build, `unichr(0x10345)` simply fails; `len(u'\U00010345')` is `2`. This is the price you pay for easy interaction with Win32 UTF-16LE APIs. Most other environments use UCS-4 which doesn't suffer from any such problem.	0	0

I'm assuming they work in a similar mode to Crystal Reports with which I'm reasonably familar. Thanks, Rob.	0	0

If you are on 11g you are in Luck :-) you can Use SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED in the Cursor - then you are guaranteed that two threads will never get the same row on a fetch!The RIGHT WAY to do this in Oracle would be Advanced Queueing - since this will solve ALL YOUR PROBLEMS, provides synchronization und parallel execution and other benefits...Before Oracle 11 and without Advanced Queuing (if you really want to code it yourself...) You can do it like this:(The bits marked with autonomous transaction have to be called in a separate method as an autonomous transaction.

To add something to this (cause I found it while searching on this problem, and my solution involved slightly more)... If you don't have a "Browse with..." option for .aspx files (as I didn't in a MVC application), the easiest solution is to add a dummy HTML file, and right-click it to set the option as described in the answer. You can remove the file afterward. The option is actually set in: C:\Documents and Settings[user]\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio[version]\browser.xml However, if you modify the file directly while VS is running, VS will overwrite it with your previous option on next run. Also, if you edit the default in VS you won't have to worry about getting the schema right, so the work-around dummy file is probably the easiest way.	0	0

What you can do here is hide the button that pushes the view that only instructors can see, if the user is logged in is of type student.In the view that has the button that pushes the view that only instructors can use do this:In the .h file create a property for the button that pushes the view like so: In the .m file:In the viewWillAppear method of the view do the following check: This way, when the view loads, the button that pushes the instructor view will only be accessible to the users of type "Instructor".Hope it helps!	0	0
Well, keep in mind that (in theory) you have the original code to help, as well as the text of the log messages. The only thing that should be obfuscated would be the class and member names. In addition, many tools (Dotfuscator is one) create a map file to tell you what obfuscated construct name maps back to which original name - this can make it a pain to figure out exactly where the log messages come from, but nowhere near impossible.	0	0

Like others I'm using larger fonts, since getting on the plus side of fifty. Most recently I started using the Consolas typeface and have really enjoyed it. Fixed width indents well.

A unit test should do the same thing every time that it runs, otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fails occasionally, and that could be a real pain to debug. Try seeding your pseudo-randomizer with the same seed every time (in the test, that is--not in production code). That way your test will generate the same set of inputs every time. If you can't control the seed and there is no way to prevent the function you are testing from being randomized, then I guess you are stuck with an unpredictable unit test. :(	0	0

This is how you find the arc length given the parameter, but finding equidistant points requires the inverse of this function.

Firstly, that's not how works. You have to specify constants for each , and those constants will be compared to the expression in parentheses (in your case, ). That is how works, period.

One potentially valid reason to impose some maximum password length is that the process of hashing it (due to the use of a slow hashing function such as bcrypt) takes up too much time; something that could be abused in order to execute a DOS attack against the server. Then again, servers should be configured to automatically drop request handlers that take too long. So I doubt this would be much of a problem.	0	0

You should prepare your statement only once, outside of the loop, and then bind the parameters in the loop. This is why prepared statements have bind parameters - so you can reuse the prepared statement. Hibernate does exactly this, treating all SQL as a prepared statement behind the scenes, though you can obviously abuse this if you use literal rather than bind parameters.	0	0
