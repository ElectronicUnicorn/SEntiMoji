is there anyway to have two TextView in one AutoCompleteTextView result? e.g. And so on... The ArrayAdapter only allows one binding for a view so how could I bind more views in the adapter? Like so: I've created a new xml layout for the layout parameter in the ArrayAdapter except when I bind the TextView to the string array, it only sets the text to the TextView with the given id. I've also searched through the other posts about this one and it did not suit my needs. If anyone could help that would be absolutely great :) Thank you.	0	0

I need someone to point me in the right direction on this.... In my Android application I have a ListView with custom views for each row containing various textviews each. I retrieve weather information for multiple locations and then want to write the results for each location to its own listview item. The question is, how do I refer to each textview on each listview item? I can't do it by name using , can I? If there are three items in the list, will the temperature textview for each item be names the same, just differ by an array index? If so, how do I specify TextViewName(0), TextViewName(1) and TextViewName (2) for the three list items? Yes, I'm still very new to Android....but loving it!	0	0

To save you some time, look to other solutions.I'm working on this exact task now, but I'm about to give up due to Cloud SQL's very poor performance. It might work fine for websites like Orane's, but for larger more complex websites the high latency and slow response time from Cloud SQL means for us 3 second load times instead of 0.7s that we have on our VPS. I have tested by connecting to both IP and Socket, SSL and without, and it's just not usable as-is. If you test with Amazon RDS, the difference in speed is shocking.The only other solution we've been able to come up with is to set up an API server that continously caches data to memcache and only serve static pages on App Engine with most dynamic content loading through AJAX.

If you or anyone can provide some assistance that would be extremely helpful! Thanks!	0	0

In my mental model of authentication, a user should be distinct from the way they log in. So for example, a User could have an associated EmailLogin (with an email/password), or they could have many (or none). Similarly they could have 0..* associated OpenIDLogin credentials. Are there any existing authentication libraries for Rails which use this method? Alternatively, is this a really terrible idea?	0	0

I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.	0	0

A couple of issues with your code that may be causing the problem is as follows:Do not EVER escape binary data prior to insertionInserting binary data from an upload into the database is a huge no-no. This can inadvertently lead to some very malicious attacks on your server that extend beyond simple SQL injection.That being said, it is not know what the field type is that you are trying to store into, nor how large the image file is. Storing a 2GB upload as a field in a database is probably not a wise idea, but if you wanted to store large images, it is recommended to stream the data into a BLOB field.For smaller files, you can them safely into fields or if allocated enough space.	0	0

I assume you're using Ken Reitz's excellent requests library to do the HTTP requests (if not, you really should be!)Most likely, the problem is that requests doesn't add a 'Content-type' header to multi-part uploads, and packmgr doesn't read multi-part bodies with no 'Content-type' header. So, while a normal 'requests' POST of a multipart-encoded file would go something like this: you instead have to use the longer form, setting an explicit content-type: Note that one side-effect of doing it this way is that it cannot stream the file - the entire package ZIP file will be read into memory.	0	0

To add something to this (cause I found it while searching on this problem, and my solution involved slightly more)... If you don't have a "Browse with..." option for .aspx files (as I didn't in a MVC application), the easiest solution is to add a dummy HTML file, and right-click it to set the option as described in the answer. You can remove the file afterward. The option is actually set in: C:\Documents and Settings[user]\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio[version]\browser.xml However, if you modify the file directly while VS is running, VS will overwrite it with your previous option on next run. Also, if you edit the default in VS you won't have to worry about getting the schema right, so the work-around dummy file is probably the easiest way.	0	0

@joe Yes, if I were to declare the property and synthesize it as above, but I don't explicitly declare an ivar myself, the compiler will still actually create the ivar.

I completely agree with you on that subject.

I'm running socket.io/node.js on my EC2 auto-scaling array of servers. As soon as I have more than 1 server, there is the obvious problem where the socket.io connections need to be shared between the servers. This is where you'd normally use the redis store plugin that comes with socket.io. Unfortunately, I use MongoDB (not redis), and the cost of adding another database to my stack would be prohibitively high. I tried using the module, but it absolutely killed my servers (huge CPU usage). Is there any other way to share the socket.io session between EC2 servers?	0	0

The most correct/idiomatic solution (if you cannot avoid having a collection to begin with) is to use an : Putting the into a lambda isn't going to make anything any easier. In fact, it'll only create more work.Of course if you really hate using an you can avoid it, not that it'll really help you much: You could emulate the more functional style concept with a method that invokes an action if the object isn't , not that this is really any easier than a check when dealing with actions instead of functions:	0	0

This is horrible. First you're sleeping, which will never wait exactly the right amount of time. It may fail if the computer is busy and shutdown takes longer than expected.

In my personal opinion, I would make theUILabels as properties of the UIView, so option 2. You can then access them from the view easily through the controller. This also gives you the advantage of reusability from the view to any controller, and since dealloc will get rid of those from the UIView, you only worry about cleanup once!	0	0

I am trying to figure out why foundation is acting differently to expected behaviour.

It transitions to a darker shade of grey. Have I missed some setting? Really frustrating me! I am guessing this is a bug in foundation	0	0

I have just about finished adding all of the content to each page of my website. I've noticed, however, when I navigate between links some of the pages shift to the right about 10 px or so. This is extremely irritating. All of my pages are contained within the same container using a fluid grid. However, not all pages have the same amount of content. I noticed that pages with empty divs don't shift when I navigate between them. However, if I navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content, I see the shift. Should this be happening if all of my pages are using the same container, same fluid grid? Does this make sense? Can you sense my desperation?	0	0

Is there a way to reuse a 3rd party control reference? For example, I have this referenced in my App.xaml I don't want to repeat this 3rd party control xml namespace on each page/control that needs a control from the library. Is there anyway to centralize these references and use the prefix defined here? The possibility of each control having a different prefix is also worrisome.

Nope, I don't think such a magic function exists.
