Instead of loading everything which is neither possible nor really desirable I would use a sliding window instead - when you reach a certain maximum list size (say i.e. 300 items) you automatically remove the top 100 items when you add the next 100 items to the bottom. If you scroll just right after the update this shouldn't even be noticeable by your users.	0	0
@Styxxy, It looks like the GPMC is explicitly designed for AD GPO's and/or doesn't support modifying GPO values, and the process for tracking registry values doesn't seem to apply to many of the Local GP's that can be modified in the gpedit.msc interface (procmon shows no registry changes while making the change). Example: 2012SP1: "Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\Perform volume maintenance tasks" add/remove SID to the list. If you or anyone can provide some assistance that would be extremely helpful! Thanks!	1	1
It comes down to 'designing for testability'. Ideally, you should not instantiate those COM objects directly but should access them through a layer of indirection that can be replaced by a mock object. Now, COM itself does provide a level of indirection and you could provide a mock object that provided a substitute for the real one but I suspect it would be a pain to create and I doubt if you'd get much help from an existing mocking framework.	0	0

Per https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/ChangingAppStatus.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011225-CH30-SW1The "pending an Apple Release" means: Apple is holding your app version until the corresponding Apple iOS or OS version is released to the public. If you think an app should be released on existing iOS or OS versions, review the deployment target set in your app binary. If you rebuild your app binary with a different deployment target, reject the binary for this version and submit the new version.Sounds like you need to review the deployment target and if you change it, reject the binary and re-submit. If you need help with rejecting the binary, please let me know.Hope this helps!	0	0

It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program's design more precise.Next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as . After having done this you can use .Here's how: Be warned that it's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs, but this option won't hurt much if you're just trying to disable a function. By the way, this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it, it's now up to you to choose which method will receive this. Hope this was helpful!	0	0

Is there some sort of ThemeRoller-compliant dialog generator, or even a script to hack the right display classes into a dialog after the fact? Or, since I'm not intending to let my users edit their own themes, do I just have to do the bit of CSS hackery that the jQuery people apparently did , putting color information into ui.dialog.css?	0	0

Why use a `Mutex` here? The `Acquire` method just returns a reference to an instance (this is a reference type). Whether the object referenced is mutable or immutable is irrelevant. The reference is to the same object no matter if the object mutates. Why do locking? Even if the instance was not "singleton" or "read-only", i.e. even if the field reference could change, since [reference assignments are atomic](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5209623/), there would still be no need for locking/`Mutex`.

Not really, you have to declare the functions somewhere visible to the caller. Header file is the most convenient way to do it, because it provides an interface. A possible approach is to merge those headers into one .h file, so you provide a single and complete interface with your library. The only other approach I can think about is declaring the functions in the files where you call them, but this is much more devastating and error prone then including a header file.	0	0

MySQL is extremely cheap when you have the distro (or staff to build) that carries MySQL Enterprise edition. This is a High Availability version which offers multi-master replication over many servers. Pros are low (license-) costs after initial purchase of hardware (Gigs of RAM needed!) and time to set up. The drawbacks are suboptimal performance with many joins, no full-text indexing, stored procesures (I think) and one need to replicate grants to every master node. Yet it's easier to run than the replication/proxy balancing setup that's available for PostgreSQL.	0	0

I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.	0	0

For direct testing, I'd embed the snippets directly into the test case: Ah, I see another change I subtly made while writing the test: my ExamplesToCode.parse() returns an Array (or other iterable container), so that it can be tested apart from the iteration itself.	0	0

I'm looking for a reliable, implementation-independent way to clone an entire Document. The Javadocs specifically say that calling cloneNode on a Document is implementation-specific. I've tried passing the Document through a no-op Transformer, but the resulting Node has no owner Document. I could create a new Document and import the nodes from the old one, but I'm afraid there might be bits of Document metadata that get lost. Same thing with writing the Document to a string and parsing it back in. Any ideas? By the way, I'm stuck at Java 1.4.2, for reasons beyond my control.	0	0

I can't help think that making XML ad XMLList both unrelated, as in both extend Object directly, is a design flaw in the AS3 core library. Surely having XML extend XMLList would be a much cleaner system, where XML is considered an XMLList with only one member?

A container is a concept in IoC where the object model, including dependencies (relationships between "user" object and "used" object) and object instances, reside and is managed -- e.g., contained. The container is usually provided by a IoC framework, such as Spring. Think of it as a runtime repository for the objects that make up your application.	0	0

I am looking for a very fast way to filter down a collection in C#. I am currently using generic List<object> collections, but am open to using other structures if they perform better.

@gbjbaanb, Why are you even talking about builds **here**? Read the question again. The deltas are significantly smaller for the files you are talking about because there are common bits between versions to take advantage of. Not so for video files. Add a 5 minute preview to the start of your video file and the bytes of the *entire* video file changes. There are no common bits a general-purpose `diff` can take advantage of, which is exactly the reason why your out-of-the-box git and hg fail miserably for these binary files.	0	0

[GNU] make gets angry if you don't place the output in the current directory. What you really should do is run make from the build directory, and use the VPATH make variable to locate the source code. If you lie to a compiler, sooner or later it will take its revenge. If you insist on generating your objects and dependencies in some other directory, you need to use the -o argument as answered by Emile.	0	0

Make a canvas path glow by applying a series of overlapping shadows with increasing blurA Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/m1erickson/Z3Lx2/You can change the styling of the glow by varying the number of overlays and the blur size.Example code for a glow effect: To get the outline path of your phone image, you can use the "marching ants" algorithm.This algorithm will create a path that outlines an image. In your case you would define the image as all pixels that are not transparent.Here's a very good implementation of "marching ants" that is used in the excellent d3 library:https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/blob/master/geom/contour/contour.jsIt's used like this:DrawImage your phone on the canvas. Get the pixel color array from the canvas using ctx.getImageData Define a function that checks the pixel array for non-transparent pixels at any x,y on the canvas. Call the contour function: Here's an example result:the glow is automatically generated using overlapping shadowsthe outline path of the phone is calculated using the marching ants algorithm	0	0

Okay, I see your confusion and edited my response with some sample code/an appropriate link to wikipedia. You are confusing the entropy of the model's probability distribution with the cross entropy (or likelihood) of the predictions it makes on real data. Consider a model that assigns probability 1 to some event and probability 0 to everything else. It has 0 entropy, but makes absolutely terrible predictions on any testing distribution that isn't a purely non-random sequence, assigning 0 probability to events that actually happen.	0	0
