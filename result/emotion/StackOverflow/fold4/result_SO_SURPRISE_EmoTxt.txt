Does anyone have a recommendation for an excellent reference on Microsoft's ReportViewer (VS 2008 flavour) when used in local mode? I'm currently using it but parts of it are a bit of a black box so I'd like to read up on the entire subject. Especially want to start using sub-reports to display more complex parent-child reports. I'm assuming they work in a similar mode to Crystal Reports with which I'm reasonably familar. Thanks, Rob.	0	0
The STL might be simple, but that's only one part of the C++ standard library. The iostreams library have nothing to do with (what was once) the STL. STL is basically contianers + iterators + algorithms. Iostreams, locales and all that has a completely different origin, and is generally a pain to work with ;)	0	0

I'm trying to create a grid (matrix) of squares in a given area with n columns and m rows, and an option to set a spacing between the squares if desired.

Not for me, but I can suggest some possibilities :It may cause problem while editing--> This can be solved by using some comments--> And then this will cause the code messier Some code may crash and your code success will go away from you |.|--> No solution - unless you know more about the code! Code upgrade problem-- If external code has upgrade you may have problem to know which is that code--> Again use comments--> And again messier So these are some that I can think about!EDIT---Some cons:You can make it more convenient to edit--> You can edit more than one code at onceYou can edit some code that you wan't able to edit (external resource before)--> Modifying is more convenient.You can make it load faster--> 1 file with 1000 KB is faster than 1000 files with 1 KB each.It is safer--> You don't need to worry about external resource being deleted!!These are my suggestions.

I'm working with a console application (C#) at the moment. What it does is pulls files from a database and stores them in their relevant folders on the C drive on a local machine.

What I would like to be able to do, is each time I run it, It only pulls the files that were submitted since I last ran the console application. Currently, this is the linq statement that pulls the files from the database.

Why use a `Mutex` here? The `Acquire` method just returns a reference to an instance (this is a reference type). Whether the object referenced is mutable or immutable is irrelevant. The reference is to the same object no matter if the object mutates. Why do locking? Even if the instance was not "singleton" or "read-only", i.e. even if the field reference could change, since [reference assignments are atomic](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5209623/), there would still be no need for locking/`Mutex`.

This isn't really a coding question, but I wanted to ask about what is more efficient and what should I use. I am making a tutorials website, and each tutorial is brought up onto a page "blog.php" on which all data comes from the database. Now I have two ways I can fill in the meta keywords tag and meta description tag. I was thinking of making 2 new columns in the blogs table, keywords, and description, and the meta tags would be filled up correspondingly from the database, and the database would get the keywords and description from user input (whover wrote the blog). I know how I would do this but is this efficient? Because I heard search engines have a harder time reading stuff from the database, so I wanted to make sure. So I can use that OR do you recommend that I use JQuery to get text from the title tag and use that type of stuff? It would be really great because I was hoping to use PHP to make it dynamic, but if I should use Jquery and javascript then please tell which is better! Thanks!	0	0
I am running applications on my windows server that run on Java 1.4 In the bottom right hand corner, Java wants me to update. Is this going to update to Java 1.6, or do these auto-updates only put out non breaking patches and my system will still be Java 1.4 Any insight would be great! Thanks.	0	0
Assuming I have only the class name of a generic as a string in the form of "MyCustomGenericCollection(of MyCustomObjectClass)" and don't know the assembly it comes from, what is the easiest way to create an instance of that object? If it helps, I know that the class implements IMyCustomInterface and is from an assembly loaded into the current AppDomain. Markus Olsson gave an excellent example , but I don't see how to apply it to generics.	0	0

No buddy, You can't simply upgrade ZF1 to ZF2. In case you need you move to ZF2 be sure that ZF2 is not just an upper version of ZF1 but the whole Architecture is also changed.So, If you really need to move then 1. Firstly you will need to remove ZF1 library completely.2. Install ZF2 package.3. Now make changes in your code to work accordingly with ZF2 as most of the things will stop working once to move to ZF2.However, I would suggest don't migrate to ZF2 just for the sake of upgrading, migrate only if you dont have any other choice. As this is a very painful task.have a good luck.	0	0

The class in Java has only two data members, a reference to an array and a sizeâ€”which you need anyway if you don't use an . So the only advantage to not using an is saving one object allocation, which is unlikely ever to be a big deal. If you're creating and disposing of many, many instances of your container class (and by extension your instance) every second, you might have a slight problem with garbage collection churnâ€”but that's something to worry about if it ever occurs. Garbage collection is typically the least of your worries.	0	0

The problem here is that you already stringified the response as JSON before passing that into another data structure (now as a string) in order to return that as JSON.

There are many libraries that make cross-platform development easier on their own, but making a complete wrapper for all platforms ends up being either small and highly customized, or massive and completely ridiculous.

I'm afraid that is not possible. Maybe you can take another approach: build an alternate way for users to change the permissions of an item.

First off, 16*16*3*3 = 2304 - quite modest really. At this size I'd be more worried about the confusion likely to be caused by a 4D array than the size it is taking!

If the Strings are just IDs, why not store an enum (or even Integers) instead of a string?	0	0

I can only repeat what others have said. Parametrized SQL is the way to go.

Okay, I see your confusion and edited my response with some sample code/an appropriate link to wikipedia. You are confusing the entropy of the model's probability distribution with the cross entropy (or likelihood) of the predictions it makes on real data.

It has 0 entropy, but makes absolutely terrible predictions on any testing distribution that isn't a purely non-random sequence, assigning 0 probability to events that actually happen.	0	0

I have an application where I need to adjust view position according to current focused subview (it's a list with focusable items, current focused item must be in the center of the screen - used for a tv application controlled from tv remote). Position must be adjusted with animation. I got it working with just one problem: if the user changes focus before the animation is complete (quickly taps "up" button twice) next animation starts with "jump" - it starts from the same position as did the first one. So what I try to do is I cancel previous animation and start another, but then new animation starts from the point where first animation was started, so user can see a very obvious jumps in the animation, which look really awful. Here's the code: So must question is: how can I start translate animation from the point where previous translate animation left on (assuming that it was cancelled)?

I have a VB.NET MDI WinForms app. My users have been complaining about form creep (as they call it), this is where each time you open a specific form within the main MDI window it opens slightly below and to the right of the location it loaded previously - i.e. it starts in the top left of the window and works its way down to the bottom right. I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating, is there any way to prevent this? The code to load the forms is: I can address this somewhat by setting the forms start-up positions to 'Manual' but then they just open directly on top of each other in the top left of the screen.

For C/C++ on Windows you have (at least) two choices: Use the SerialPort class provided by .NET. Use the Win32 API. There is an dating back to 1995, and many free libraries and examples on the web to get you started. The .NET option will be much easier.	0	0
If you can edit the code, you should just re-write it to use a custom API that does what you want. Failing that, use Maximilian's technique, but be warned that it is a maintenance horror. If you cannot edit the code, you can patch the import tables to redirect calls to your own code. A description of this technique can be found in - search for the section titled "Spying by altering of the Import Address Table". This is dangerous, but if you're careful you can make it work. Also check out , which does the same sort of thing but doesn't require you to mess around with the actual patching.	0	0

I am planning to migrate the application from 1.1 to 1.2 in the somewhat near future and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this? I have attempted to migrate a system from 1.0 to 1.1 and that was a major pain in the rear. How has it been for anyone out there migrating from Symfony 1.1 to 1.2?	0	0

I am using some PHP script to add some data from a complex form to MySQL db and then showing it all in some HTML table. Everything works just fine, but I would like to 'upgrade' my script with jQuery and (I suppose) AJAX. What I would like to do is when user submits data, the row (or ) shows up in the HTML table without refreshing a page. Form and table are on same page, of course... Some guidelines would be really helpful because I'm not sure should I even use AJAX or something else for my needs. Links for some tutorials will be also great :) Thanks a lot for any help!	0	0
As I'm a former C++ programmer that code makes me cringe. Multiple postincrements in C/C++ have "undefined behaviour" (i.e. it's an error, but the compiler won't tell you so.) It's legal in C# and Java will always output "1,2,3" but your C++ programmer colleagues will hate it.	0	0

I am sorry to say this but most Silverlight grids do not support cell merging. At least not out of the box.

I'm not sure if this is a case here but if you are really worried about the gc in this case and you'd like to better control behavior of your derived maps and thus their influence on the performance of the gc in my opinion you should take a look at the usage of different kind of references (strong, weak, soft, phantom) in java.Also remember that pre-optimization is a root of all evil especially in programming.	0	0

I think it should be a warning. Generally speaking, the common rule is that 'you should treat warnings as errors'. If I unintentionally write unreachable code, I will see it in the warnings, and fix it anyway.
