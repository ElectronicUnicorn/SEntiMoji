I have an application where I need to adjust view position according to current focused subview (it's a list with focusable items, current focused item must be in the center of the screen - used for a tv application controlled from tv remote). Position must be adjusted with animation. I got it working with just one problem: if the user changes focus before the animation is complete (quickly taps "up" button twice) next animation starts with "jump" - it starts from the same position as did the first one. So what I try to do is I cancel previous animation and start another, but then new animation starts from the point where first animation was started, so user can see a very obvious jumps in the animation, which look really awful. Here's the code: So must question is: how can I start translate animation from the point where previous translate animation left on (assuming that it was cancelled)?

So to do this I would keep a list of axes and when I delete the contents of one I would swap it out with a full one.

When we have a cluster of machines behind a load balancer (lb), generally hardware load balancer have persistent connections, Now when we need to deploy some update on all machines (rolling update), the way to do is by bringing one machine Out of rotation, looks for no request sent to that server via lb.

I assume you're using Ken Reitz's excellent requests library to do the HTTP requests (if not, you really should be!)Most likely, the problem is that requests doesn't add a 'Content-type' header to multi-part uploads, and packmgr doesn't read multi-part bodies with no 'Content-type' header. So, while a normal 'requests' POST of a multipart-encoded file would go something like this: you instead have to use the longer form, setting an explicit content-type: Note that one side-effect of doing it this way is that it cannot stream the file - the entire package ZIP file will be read into memory.	0	0

What are you trying to sort? Is there any reason not to use: I'm sure this uses QuickSort and you don't have to worry about making any coding errors.

We're in the process of packaging combinations of our products/modules. Some of them are stand-alone some are interdependent. All versions must be deployable side-by-side.

The class in Java has only two data members, a reference to an array and a sizeâ€”which you need anyway if you don't use an . So the only advantage to not using an is saving one object allocation, which is unlikely ever to be a big deal. If you're creating and disposing of many, many instances of your container class (and by extension your instance) every second, you might have a slight problem with garbage collection churnâ€”but that's something to worry about if it ever occurs. Garbage collection is typically the least of your worries.	0	0

I have just about finished adding all of the content to each page of my website. I've noticed, however, when I navigate between links some of the pages shift to the right about 10 px or so.

I noticed that pages with empty divs don't shift when I navigate between them. However, if I navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content, I see the shift.

Not really, you have to declare the functions somewhere visible to the caller. Header file is the most convenient way to do it, because it provides an interface. A possible approach is to merge those headers into one .h file, so you provide a single and complete interface with your library. The only other approach I can think about is declaring the functions in the files where you call them, but this is much more devastating and error prone then including a header file.	0	0

@DaveBish, What an excellent tool! I will be using this ALOT in future! :-)	0	0
Not for me, but I can suggest some possibilities :It may cause problem while editing--> This can be solved by using some comments--> And then this will cause the code messier Some code may crash and your code success will go away from you |.|--> No solution - unless you know more about the code! Code upgrade problem-- If external code has upgrade you may have problem to know which is that code--> Again use comments--> And again messier So these are some that I can think about!EDIT---Some cons:You can make it more convenient to edit--> You can edit more than one code at onceYou can edit some code that you wan't able to edit (external resource before)--> Modifying is more convenient.You can make it load faster--> 1 file with 1000 KB is faster than 1000 files with 1 KB each.It is safer--> You don't need to worry about external resource being deleted!!These are my suggestions. Try to think more about it!	0	0

In netbeans, if I select some text and press , it works correctly and the text is indented to the right side as expected. But if I then try to backspace behind the text, it only removes one space at a time. Very annoying.

You could use a : Of course this code looks extremely ugly in C#. Depending on what manipulations you are performing on those strings you could take advantage of the features built into C# to convert it into a one-liner and avoid writing all those imperative loops. This is to say that when converting source code from one language to another it's not a matter of simply searching for the equivalent data type, etc... You could also take advantage of what the target language has to offer.	0	0

The problem here is that you already stringified the response as JSON before passing that into another data structure (now as a string) in order to return that as JSON. So you are basically doing a double encode and the "string" gets encoded.So just pass in the data once: So on a small collection like this: Yo get a result like this: If you are really worried about the order of those two keys then you can use the bson "dumps" to go to a string then decode with the standard json decoder in order to get a native dict with the Mongo objects deserialized, then further put into your ordered dict.But really your client should not care about the order of the keys and just expect those root elements.	0	0

For example, the wordlist contains the following words ["abuser, abused, abusers, abuse, abuses, etc.] The new file that is created should retain only the word "abuse" because it is the "lowest common denominator" (if you will) between all those words.

No buddy, You can't simply upgrade ZF1 to ZF2. In case you need you move to ZF2 be sure that ZF2 is not just an upper version of ZF1 but the whole Architecture is also changed.So, If you really need to move then 1. Firstly you will need to remove ZF1 library completely.2. Install ZF2 package.3. Now make changes in your code to work accordingly with ZF2 as most of the things will stop working once to move to ZF2.However, I would suggest don't migrate to ZF2 just for the sake of upgrading, migrate only if you dont have any other choice. As this is a very painful task.have a good luck.	0	0
