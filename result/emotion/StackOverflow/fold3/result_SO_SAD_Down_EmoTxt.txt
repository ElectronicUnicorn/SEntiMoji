Eruby is an external executable, while erb is a library within Ruby. You would use the former if you wanted independent processing of your template files (e.g. quick-and-dirty PHP replacement), and the latter if you needed to process them within the context of some other Ruby script. It is more common to use ERB simply because it is more flexible, but I'll admit that I have been guilty of dabbling in eruby to execute files for quick little utility websites.	1	1

With no offense, just as one developer to another, I'm afraid that your idea seems terribly inefficient. It seems to me that instead of uniting SQLite databases you should probably be storing several tables within the same Database file. However if I'm mistaken I guess you could ATTACH the databases and then use a VIEW to simplify your queries. Or make an in-memory table and copy over all the data (but that's even worse performance wise, especially if you have large databases)	1	0

I have a somewhat complicated issue. I have a grid defined (using the Struts2-JQuery Grid Plugin).

I have two files. File 1: a FASTA file with gene sequences, formated like this example: File 2: A simple text file with JUST the accession identification of the gene. Like so. Every entry in File 2 is somewhere in File 1, but not every entry in File 1 is in File 2. I need to remove all the entries from File 1 that are not in File 2. I feel like there must be something in the biopython module that could help me, I just don't know what. For instance, I originally thought that I could extract just the accessions from my FASTA file using the function, but this really just lands me with two files of accession numbers. I don't know how to selectively extract the accessions that are in the other file. Maybe like reading all the entries from File 2 into a dictionary and then associated that entry with its matching entry in File 1 and use to extract the whole sequence...But I really don't know....Any help anyone could give me is extremely appreciated!	0	0

It comes down to 'designing for testability'. Ideally, you should not instantiate those COM objects directly but should access them through a layer of indirection that can be replaced by a mock object. Now, COM itself does provide a level of indirection and you could provide a mock object that provided a substitute for the real one but I suspect it would be a pain to create and I doubt if you'd get much help from an existing mocking framework.	1	0

Background: I'm currently debugging an application written over a custom-built GUI framework in C++. I've managed to pin down most bugs, but the bugs I'm having the most trouble with tend to have a common theme. All of them seem to be to do with the screen refreshing, redrawing or updating to match provided data. This is a pain to debug, because I can't break on every refresh, and most of this stuff is time-sensitive, so breakpoints occasionally "fix" the bug.

@Styxxy, It looks like the GPMC is explicitly designed for AD GPO's and/or doesn't support modifying GPO values, and the process for tracking registry values doesn't seem to apply to many of the Local GP's that can be modified in the gpedit.msc interface (procmon shows no registry changes while making the change). Example: 2012SP1: "Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\Perform volume maintenance tasks" add/remove SID to the list. If you or anyone can provide some assistance that would be extremely helpful! Thanks!	0	0

The length of a Python Unicode string in a narrow-Unicode build is the number of UTF-16 *code units*, not actual Unicode code points. Truncating and other slicing options that go by arbitrary index can indeed split a surrogate pair in half, with the result of some missing/replaced characters. On a narrow build, `unichr(0x10345)` simply fails; `len(u'\U00010345')` is `2`. This is the price you pay for easy interaction with Win32 UTF-16LE APIs. Most other environments use UCS-4 which doesn't suffer from any such problem.	0	0

I am sorry to say this but most Silverlight grids do not support cell merging. At least not out of the box. I have resorted to using Component One studio for Silverlight in order to achieve this, and even then it hasn't been exactly a walk in the park. Consider C1 Data Grid control. Here is a sample on with sample code and a small write up. The down side of such solutions is that C1's controls are extremely expensive :( I wish Micro$oft came up with some enhancements in SL5 that would accommodate for such issues.	1	1

I just started practicing TDD in my projects. I'm developing a project now using php/zend/mysql and phpunit/dbunit for testing. I'm just a bit distracted on the idea of encapsulation and the test driven approach. My idea behind encapsulation is to hide access to several object functionalities. To make it more clear, private and protected functions are not directly testable(unless you will create a public function to call it). So I end up converting some private and protected functions to public functions just to be able to test them. I'm really violating the principles of encapsulation to give way to micro function testability. Is this the correct way of doing it?	0	0

A database is meant to manage large volumes of data, and are supposed to give you fast access to read and write that data in spite of the size. Put simply, they manage scale for data - scale that you don't want to deal with. If you have only a few users (hundreds?), you could just as easily manage the data on disk (say XML?) and keep the data in memory. The images should clearly not go in to the database so the question is how much data, or for how many users are you maintaining this database instance?	0	0

A unit test should do the same thing every time that it runs, otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fails occasionally, and that could be a real pain to debug. Try seeding your pseudo-randomizer with the same seed every time (in the test, that is--not in production code). That way your test will generate the same set of inputs every time. If you can't control the seed and there is no way to prevent the function you are testing from being randomized, then I guess you are stuck with an unpredictable unit test. :(	0	1

I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.	0	0

While your basic point is correct, the code you've shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question: Afaik, you get four `int` in one cache line, that means on average you get a latency of less than 30 cycles to load the data (not considering prefetching), you have conditional jumps in your loop (modern architectures hate mispredicting those), so you get much, much more than a cycle for each loop iteration. I'd wager, your swap will take at least 100 to 200 cycles, probably more, but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping (how many mispredictions are made).	0	0

Given that the remove() is relatively uncommon, I am worried that locking on each poll() will result in slow code. Are my worries justified?	0	0

I just use following code right now. The table is MyISAM 90MB. terms has FULLTEXT INDEX and it is varchar(255). There are 1,000,000 rows on the table. I wonder if there is any solution which is more resource usage friendly than fulltext search on MySQL? Especially in terms of memory. By saying solution, I refer to any solution such as other types of databases, table structures etc. and if the solution would be adaptable to a standart VPS or hosting in general, it would be extremely super duper perfect!

The question was "how important". Answer: it is NOT important at all. If you don't have a dozen servers running this app already, then this is probably early optimization, and as we all know, early optimization is the root of all evil. In other words: don't even worry about it. There are a lot of other things to optimize speed before you should even consider this.	0	0

We're looking for a package to help identify and automatically rotate faxed TIFF images based on a watermark or logo.

Guy's I am at my wit's end. I've got a VPS that I'm mucking around on, so nothing is important, but nginx is being a complete pain. I've deleted all of the content inside and restarted.

@joe Yes, if I were to declare the property and synthesize it as above, but I don't explicitly declare an ivar myself, the compiler will still actually create the ivar. So I could do `int len = [self.stringProperty length]` as you'd expect inside the class, AND I can also do `int len = [stringProperty length]` as well, without using the accessor method, just directly using the ivar (which the compiler has synthesized for me, along with setter+getter). It's really fantastic!	0	0

My application links against libsamplerate.a. I am doing this to make distributing the final binary easier. I am worried that perhaps the code inside the .a file depends on some other libraries I also will need to distribute. But if it doesn't I am worried I am bloating up my application too much by including multiple copies of eg. libc. What exactly will be inside libsamplerate.a? Just libsamperate's bytecode?

So first of all, is there any reason you don't want to add two internal div's as column containers (this is a far simpler solution)?So in order to do what your asking and not have it look completely terrible, you'd have to rearrange the div.inner's that you have there then float them to the left. I added a number to them to show their original position. So basically what I did was re-positioned them so that the left column item has about the same height as a number of right column items (1 is about the same as 2 + 5, 3 and 4 are close, and 7 is larger than 6 and 8). As for the CSS, you just add float:left; to .inner. But really the best way to do this so that all of the items in each column were touching without excessive white space would be to simply add a second set of div's.	1	0

PermGen memory can be garbage collected by full collections, so increasing it may increase the amount of GC time when a full collection takes place. These collections shouldn't take place too often though, and would typically still take less than a second to full GC 1GB of permgen memory - I'm just pulling this number from (my somewhat hazy) memory, so if you are really worried about GC times to some timing tests yourself (use and read the logs, more details )	0	0

Make a canvas path glow by applying a series of overlapping shadows with increasing blurA Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/m1erickson/Z3Lx2/You can change the styling of the glow by varying the number of overlays and the blur size.Example code for a glow effect: To get the outline path of your phone image, you can use the "marching ants" algorithm.This algorithm will create a path that outlines an image. In your case you would define the image as all pixels that are not transparent.Here's a very good implementation of "marching ants" that is used in the excellent d3 library:https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/blob/master/geom/contour/contour.jsIt's used like this:DrawImage your phone on the canvas. Get the pixel color array from the canvas using ctx.getImageData Define a function that checks the pixel array for non-transparent pixels at any x,y on the canvas. Call the contour function: Here's an example result:the glow is automatically generated using overlapping shadowsthe outline path of the phone is calculated using the marching ants algorithm	0	0
