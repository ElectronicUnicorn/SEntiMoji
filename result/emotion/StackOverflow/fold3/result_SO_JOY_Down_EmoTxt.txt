I'm currently tuning a large app that uses L2S using the following process (to great success!) Start SQL Server Profiler and create a trace using the 'Tuning' template that gets saved to a file. Then interact with your app to exercise the slow spots. Stop the trace then start up the Database Engine Tuning Advisor. You can load up the trace file you just created and have it suggest all sort of optimizations. I've just created 5 non-clustered indexes based on its suggestions and my app is easily 90% faster that it was before.	1	1
@gbjbaanb, Why are you even talking about builds **here**? Read the question again. The deltas are significantly smaller for the files you are talking about because there are common bits between versions to take advantage of. Not so for video files. Add a 5 minute preview to the start of your video file and the bytes of the *entire* video file changes. There are no common bits a general-purpose `diff` can take advantage of, which is exactly the reason why your out-of-the-box git and hg fail miserably for these binary files.	0	0

I am using Internet Explorer 11. Something annoying keeps happening when I add code to my site through the CMS form that I use. Take this line: Let's say I want to copy just this in IE, through the form on the page: When I go to copy just that section, it actually copies this: It is VERY annoying! It doesn't happen on Chrome or Firefox. For reasons with the CMS I have to use Internet Explorer. Is there a setting I can change so that doesn't happen? On Windows 7 if that helps.

So, the following hack seems to work, but it's really incredibly ugly IMO, as it relies on you controlling the line-height and using absolute positioning. Worse, it requires you to know how many lines there are in your text, which depends on the width of the div and the font-size, and probably requires JS to compute.Anyway, after all the above disclaimers, here's the hack: Use two divs with the same text, one on top of the other. One justified, one centered. Then clip the justified one.HTML CSS Fiddle.Of course, the above code is hard-coded for the specific width. Again, you'll probably need JS in order to compute the number of lines in the div. I'm pretty sure that until this gets implemented in Webkit you probably won't find an elegant solution for your problem.	0	0

I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating, is there any way to prevent this?

It is a hack that shows how it can be made possible.Discussion Because it does not load the whole file into memory, regular expressions do not work.

The first line sets the file name variables and sets the field separator to comma. The second line sets the output field separator to comma too. The third line prints lines with 3 fields to the new file; the fourth line prints lines with other than 3 fields to the error file.Note that your code would be excruciatingly slow on big files because it executes two processes per line.

This isn't really a coding question, but I wanted to ask about what is more efficient and what should I use. I am making a tutorials website, and each tutorial is brought up onto a page "blog.php" on which all data comes from the database. Now I have two ways I can fill in the meta keywords tag and meta description tag. I was thinking of making 2 new columns in the blogs table, keywords, and description, and the meta tags would be filled up correspondingly from the database, and the database would get the keywords and description from user input (whover wrote the blog). I know how I would do this but is this efficient? Because I heard search engines have a harder time reading stuff from the database, so I wanted to make sure. So I can use that OR do you recommend that I use JQuery to get text from the title tag and use that type of stuff? It would be really great because I was hoping to use PHP to make it dynamic, but if I should use Jquery and javascript then please tell which is better! Thanks!	1	0

I'm not sure if this is a case here but if you are really worried about the gc in this case and you'd like to better control behavior of your derived maps and thus their influence on the performance of the gc in my opinion you should take a look at the usage of different kind of references (strong, weak, soft, phantom) in java.Also remember that pre-optimization is a root of all evil especially in programming.	0	0

My problem with Boost (here, and elsewhere) is that you can often get on without it (in this case with C++11 or before C++11 [with a function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/138633/111307)). Boost adds a significant compile time overhead, had tons of files to park into your repository (and to have to copy around/zip/extract if you are making an archive). That's the reason I try not to use it. I know you can choose what files to include/not include, but you usually don't want to have to worry about Boost's cross dependencies with itself so you just copy the whole thing around.	0	0
In general, how expensive is locking in Java?

Some of your code seemed redundant, so I removed some. Such as defining and then duplicating it into so I just defined once. I got rid of , , and since you can just as easily enter the value directly.Then I got rid of the whole get the latest file in the log folder, and just added the content to the log file defined earlier. I changed the log entries so they were done by tabs so the entry type, date, and the actual entry all line up nicely when you view the log file.Lastly I changed the whole If>ElseIf>ElseIf thing into a Switch, because Switch is awesome and totally underused! Oh yeah, I got rid of because it's pointless to define a variable and then just echo it. What you could do is in the section have it write-host the error and call the log function again, so people are forced to enter a valid entry.	1	0

The reason to build it into the language is that it can get painful when you want a hierarchy of chainable objects that return the most derived type. Currently, you have to have `` generics to allow subclasses to change the return type so calling methods don't lose scope of the object they are calling. Building into the jvm removes this ugliness. Plus, instead of a return statement, it can just push a reference to this on the stack as needed; an "on demand return" instead of an "always return" that can be hard to optimize out when you don't use it.	0	0

This is simple I hope :) When I create a new web application in WSS does it need to be on port 80 if I want to point an external domain name at it? Everything is standard in terms of IIS and ports that are open i.e. port 80 is the only one open. I am guessing if I let WSS assign a port number to the new web application surely this can never be accessed externally unless I open the assigned port? Cheers	1	1

No buddy, You can't simply upgrade ZF1 to ZF2. In case you need you move to ZF2 be sure that ZF2 is not just an upper version of ZF1 but the whole Architecture is also changed.So, If you really need to move then 1. Firstly you will need to remove ZF1 library completely.2. Install ZF2 package.3. Now make changes in your code to work accordingly with ZF2 as most of the things will stop working once to move to ZF2.However, I would suggest don't migrate to ZF2 just for the sake of upgrading, migrate only if you dont have any other choice.

We're running into a really painful issue with Honeycomb's here, and I was wondering if anyone else has found a solution. The problem itself is quite simple: We frequently trigger background tasks in Activity or , since most of our screens must display data loaded from a Web service. While these tasks are running, we show the ActionBar's refresh spinner and animate it. The problem is: onCreate and onResume are executed before is, so at the point where we start the task, the refresh spinner doesn't even exist. Hence, it won't animate. I don't see any simple way around this. I guess we could keep the information about a task being spawned in onCreate, and as soon as the ActionBar becomes available, update it accordingly. But still, I can't believe a use case as common as this is so difficult to do with ActionBar?	1	0

Okay .. after allot of trial and error I did something (complete desperation) and it worked! This is too dumb, and if it weren't for the fact that some other person might have the same issue I'd keep this to myself ..... I simply created a VerticalFieldManager that I added all the fields to, then added that VFM to the Screen. Point in fact this should NOT make any difference - at all - as the default Manager on a Screen is a VFM. Nothing else. No other properties set, methods called, events .... nada. Go figure.	0	0

I think it should be a warning. Generally speaking, the common rule is that 'you should treat warnings as errors'. If I unintentionally write unreachable code, I will see it in the warnings, and fix it anyway. However, sometimes, like Neil says, you intentionally create dead code, for debugging purposes or whatever reason. I'd really, really hate it if the compiler would not let me do that.	0	0

When we have a cluster of machines behind a load balancer (lb), generally hardware load balancer have persistent connections, Now when we need to deploy some update on all machines (rolling update), the way to do is by bringing one machine Out of rotation, looks for no request sent to that server via lb. When the app reached no request state then update manually. With 70-80 servers in picture this becomes very painful. Can someone have a better way of doing it.	0	0

This is a slightly tricky question. I am using NSDateFormatter on the iPhone but I wanted to only show a standard date without the years component. But retain the users locale formatting for their date. I could easily override the formatting using But now the date is in my in en-nz format eg 12:01PM Wednesday July 7. So I have totally killed the locale for any other users around the world. I would like to say. Give me the correct localized date for this users region but omit the years component. Since the date is being displayed as string, I am tempted to just fromat the date and then remove the year component by just cutting this out of the string.	1	0

Using a unique identifiers would allow you to merge data from two different databases. Maybe you have an application that collects data in multiple database and then "syncs" with a master database at various times in the day. You wouldn't have to worry about primary key collisions in this scenario. Or, possibly, you might want to know what a record's ID will be before you actually create it.	0	0
