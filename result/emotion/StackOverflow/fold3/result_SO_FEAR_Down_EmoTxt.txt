I need urgent help with a CSS tumblr theme header found here grandneue.tumblr.com (1) Stretch: I want it to be able to stretch but only up to a maximum size as the header gets too pixelated otherwise), probably around 800px. (2) Shrink: The second issue I have is, while the header does shrink down to a certain size (it does when I change the desktop browser window and to a certain extent on the iphone5), it doesn't shrink down fully so it fits 100% on a vertical iphone5 browser display. Can anyone please help me solve these two queries? The content is totally fine so I don't understand why the header won't follow suit! Thanks very much!	0	0

I've been reading about MVC design for a while now and it seems officially the View calls objects and methods in the Model, builds and outputs a view. I think this is mainly wrong. The Controller should act and retrieve/update objects inside the Model, select an appropriate View and pass the information to it so it may display. Only crude and rudiementary PHP variables/simple if statements should appear inside the View. If the View gets the information it needs to display from the Model, surely there will be a lot of PHP inside the View -- completely violating the point of seperating presentation logic.	0	0

A couple of issues with your code that may be causing the problem is as follows:Do not EVER escape binary data prior to insertionInserting binary data from an upload into the database is a huge no-no. This can inadvertently lead to some very malicious attacks on your server that extend beyond simple SQL injection.That being said, it is not know what the field type is that you are trying to store into, nor how large the image file is. Storing a 2GB upload as a field in a database is probably not a wise idea, but if you wanted to store large images, it is recommended to stream the data into a BLOB field.For smaller files, you can them safely into fields or if allocated enough space.	0	0

Out of the box, in MS Reporting Services, the image element does not allow for the centering of the image itself, when the dimensions are unknown at design time. In other words, the image (if smaller than the dimensions allotted on the design surface) will be anchored to the top left corner, not in the center. My report will know the URL of the image at runtime, and I need to be able to center this image if it is smaller than the dimensions specified in my designer.	0	0

The reason to build it into the language is that it can get painful when you want a hierarchy of chainable objects that return the most derived type. Currently, you have to have `` generics to allow subclasses to change the return type so calling methods don't lose scope of the object they are calling. Building into the jvm removes this ugliness. Plus, instead of a return statement, it can just push a reference to this on the stack as needed; an "on demand return" instead of an "always return" that can be hard to optimize out when you don't use it.	0	0
@gbjbaanb, Why are you even talking about builds **here**? Read the question again.

I have an IIS6 web server that is hosting two application pools. Occasionally, one of the w3wp processes will spike the CPU for a while, and both app pools seem to suffer the consequences. I'm not sure which one is which, and without that information I don't know which application to blame. How can I tell which w3wp belongs to which App Pool?	0	0

Not really, you have to declare the functions somewhere visible to the caller. Header file is the most convenient way to do it, because it provides an interface. A possible approach is to merge those headers into one .h file, so you provide a single and complete interface with your library. The only other approach I can think about is declaring the functions in the files where you call them, but this is much more devastating and error prone then including a header file.	0	0

So, something like this for 2013: And basically the same for 2014.Cut the Trans piece out of your crossab. Then you'll nest those two calcs under your years. To get rid of all the zeroes or nulls, select the two columns. From the menu, select , , .Finally, you will drop a calc in next to your Years in the crosstab (not under them). The expression will be (or whatever you end up naming your calcs). Format it as a percent, and you should be good to go.Told you it was a pain!	0	0

Is there anyway to get the equivalents for an NSArray when compared to Java ArrayList? However, what I'm trying to do (learning Objective-C at the minute) is have a NSArray of 6 integers. Allow myself to 'index' into specific point of these integers and set an integer. Then check if the NSArray is null or zero, if not then loop through and print out integers to some label on screen (example). Is this possible? The documentation isn't the best at all it seems.

I used for a medium sized project, and loved it.

Regarding selling agile, one angle of approach is proposing agile techniques as a way of reducing the "project crunch". By this I mean the overwhelming list of deferred issues, "99% complete" code and oversights that accumulate towards the end of the project. This normally causes a lot of stress and compromises in order to meet the deadline. If a development organisation has never experienced project crunch, it would be a big surprise to me. Therefore I think this is a neat way of locking into a some shared pain and suggesting agile techniques as a load-levelling technique should provoke some interest that can lead onto a more complete discussion of the methodology(s).	1	0

Well, this is incredibly painful in Access, but you can create a numbers table on the fly. Let's assume that is really a unique id in the table. This uses the table to generate a list of numbers, using a correlated subquery to get the numbers. Note that this assumes that is always less than the number of rows in this table. If you know the ids have no gaps and start at 1, you can simplify this to:	0	0

I have a custom UITableViewController class that is shared among a few ViewControllers of my app. I would like to do pre-emptive fetching before the user has hit the bottom of the page.

I think that's absolutely terrible practice. First of all you do not need to make the trip to the server to hide and show controls, unless you need new data. Second, any decent javascript framework will allow you to hide show controls based on the control's id, class name, or whatever css selector. Moreover using a javascript post/get to a generic handler will give you the data that you need without the postback. I'd suggest using JQuery, or some other alternative.	1	0
