Its not quick to do, but you can also run FXCop, and it will alert you to objects that are IDisposable that arent in a using() block. Working on some legacy C# code here at work, I found that whoever wrote it orgininally actually made a ".Dispose()" method is almost every class, even if not needed, but the classes don't actually implement IDisposable. Which means in intellisence they all have a Dispose() method, but can't be put in using() blocks... very annoying!	0	0

To generate my private pgp key: To encrypt I'd give my shared key to a friend: To decrypt the encrypted string after being sent back to me: Obviously I know I'm skipping out on a ton of details.

@joe Yes, if I were to declare the property and synthesize it as above, but I don't explicitly declare an ivar myself, the compiler will still actually create the ivar. So I could do `int len = [self.stringProperty length]` as you'd expect inside the class, AND I can also do `int len = [stringProperty length]` as well, without using the accessor method, just directly using the ivar (which the compiler has synthesized for me, along with setter+getter).

To add something to this (cause I found it while searching on this problem, and my solution involved slightly more)... If you don't have a "Browse with..." option for .aspx files (as I didn't in a MVC application), the easiest solution is to add a dummy HTML file, and right-click it to set the option as described in the answer. You can remove the file afterward. The option is actually set in: C:\Documents and Settings[user]\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio[version]\browser.xml However, if you modify the file directly while VS is running, VS will overwrite it with your previous option on next run. Also, if you edit the default in VS you won't have to worry about getting the schema right, so the work-around dummy file is probably the easiest way.	0	0

A unit test should do the same thing every time that it runs, otherwise you may run into a situation where the unit test only fails occasionally, and that could be a real pain to debug. Try seeding your pseudo-randomizer with the same seed every time (in the test, that is--not in production code). That way your test will generate the same set of inputs every time. If you can't control the seed and there is no way to prevent the function you are testing from being randomized, then I guess you are stuck with an unpredictable unit test. :(	0	0

I am using Hibernate for my persistence layer. And if I send a web request which asks for some database data to be displayed on the webpage For the first one or two times, the server responds rightly and data are retrieved and displayed. However, when the same request is sent repeatedly ( Just by refreshing the browser by hand to resend the request), Hibernate will not respond anything. And it is choked there! Also the log message stays at the "opening hibernate session" line(shown by SessionFactoryUtils class in Spring) Any solution??	0	0

@gbjbaanb, Why are you even talking about builds **here**? Read the question again. The deltas are significantly smaller for the files you are talking about because there are common bits between versions to take advantage of. Not so for video files. Add a 5 minute preview to the start of your video file and the bytes of the *entire* video file changes. There are no common bits a general-purpose `diff` can take advantage of, which is exactly the reason why your out-of-the-box git and hg fail miserably for these binary files.	0	0

The question is has anybody used any code generation with Mono? I am open to learning something like SubSonic or NHibernate if those work better with Mono. Thanks in advance for any help.	0	0

Not really, no. I basically just took JaredPar's word for it that the threadID would be reasonably stable, used this during testing, and then changed the interface to react to OnMouseMove events instead for the final deployment.

It is, however, more reliable than the above method, which only failed once or twice during the whole of testing, but did fail.	0	0

I'm running socket.io/node.js on my EC2 auto-scaling array of servers.

Unfortunately, I use MongoDB (not redis), and the cost of adding another database to my stack would be prohibitively high.

A database is meant to manage large volumes of data, and are supposed to give you fast access to read and write that data in spite of the size.

I'm just working my way through Django, and really liking it so far, but I have an issue and I'm not sure what the typical way to solve it. Suppose I have a View which is supposed to be updated when some complex Python object is updated, but this object is not driven by the database, say it is driven by AJAX calls or directly by the user or something. Where does this code go? Should it still go in models.py????	0	0

If you are not registered, you will only be able to download the production app from Google Play, NOT the Beta or Alpha version of the app from Google Play. Having the "link" won't be sufficient, you need to opt-in to the beta or alpha via Google + or Google Group. Please note that even if you properly opt-in via Google + or Google Groups as defined by the developer, you will need to wait several hours (perhaps 2-8 hours) for your status to propagate via Google Play.

While your basic point is correct, the code you've shown is much slower than the two versions given in the question: Afaik, you get four `int` in one cache line, that means on average you get a latency of less than 30 cycles to load the data (not considering prefetching), you have conditional jumps in your loop (modern architectures hate mispredicting those), so you get much, much more than a cycle for each loop iteration. I'd wager, your swap will take at least 100 to 200 cycles, probably more, but that heavily depends on the numbers you are swapping (how many mispredictions are made).	0	0

You have two divs, one over the other, and the one on top is transparent. However, when you scroll you want the div on the bottom to hide as it goes under the first transparent div. You don't want the second div's to change to as soon as it goes under the first div. You just want the part that is under to be hidden. I've googled extensively for an answer: #1-4 answer make the div on top or . The problem with this for me is my background is a photograph, i.e. as you scroll down what you see is different, as opposed to a colour or a pattern. The "background" of the transparent div needs to change as the real background changes. #5 offers a solution to this using JQuery however there are horrible, horrible issues with scroll lag in browsers not Firefox.

Not really, you have to declare the functions somewhere visible to the caller. Header file is the most convenient way to do it, because it provides an interface. A possible approach is to merge those headers into one .h file, so you provide a single and complete interface with your library. The only other approach I can think about is declaring the functions in the files where you call them, but this is much more devastating and error prone then including a header file.	0	0

You are processing the newline character as if it is legitimate input. You should either read the entire line (including the newline, perhaps using a ) and then process the first character of the line or simply add a test to skip newlines in your loop logic.P.S. Converting case by adding or subtracting 32 is a really awful approach. It won't work with anything but a-z and A-Z (in the English alphabet). It won't work for most characters outside the Basic Latin block and shouldn't be used at all for characters that have no alternate case (such as newline). You should be using and instead.	0	0

These collections shouldn't take place too often though, and would typically still take less than a second to full GC 1GB of permgen memory - I'm just pulling this number from (my somewhat hazy) memory, so if you are really worried about GC times to some timing tests yourself (use and read the logs, more details )	0	0

I'm looking for a reliable, implementation-independent way to clone an entire Document. The Javadocs specifically say that calling cloneNode on a Document is implementation-specific. I've tried passing the Document through a no-op Transformer, but the resulting Node has no owner Document. I could create a new Document and import the nodes from the old one, but I'm afraid there might be bits of Document metadata that get lost. Same thing with writing the Document to a string and parsing it back in. Any ideas? By the way, I'm stuck at Java 1.4.2, for reasons beyond my control.	0	0

This is flat wrong I'm afraid - you should follow W3C guidelines: http://www.w3schools.com/DTD/dtd_el_vs_attr.asp - XML should not be formed on readability or on making it "compact" - but rather using elements or attributes correctly for the purpose which they were designed for.	0	0

My suggestion is to keep track of whether or not you're showing an error at that choke point. If you have lots of places that are doing it, you'd need to synchronize them somehow, e.g. delegate to a singleton object that is responsible for displaying the UI, or use a mutex or something.	0	0
