It would be a good practice to have a separate button that will disable method since it is very easy to get confused when using your program if the code for disabling and enabling this method is all written in one method named so I suggest you separate them to make the program's design more precise.Next thing you can do is to execute a , whic you are going to mark as . After having done this you can use .Here's how: Be warned that it's sometimes dangerous to throw exceptions as it creates some other bugs, but this option won't hurt much if you're just trying to disable a function. By the way, this will really not remove the method as it will just replace it, it's now up to you to choose which method will receive this. Hope this was helpful!	0	0

I have been trying to create a slider based on Nivo Slider that looks and functions similar to the Carousel found at I have viewed questions by and by , however I have been going round in circles for most of the weekend. Now back at square one and starting from the basics. Thus far I have managed to get the navigation working such that mouseenter on a particular nav item triggers nivo-controlNav to display the correct slide and pauses the slider: I also created a subsequent mouseleave function for the nav items (1,2,3 etc.) I'm now stuck at the part where non-mouse events come in. When the slider loads it should update the nav css to highlight the current nav item selected. Here is what I've got (not a lot I know, but I'm trying). Then the simple html nav menu: Any help/ideas/musings would be hugely appreciated!	0	0

I'm working with a console application (C#) at the moment. What it does is pulls files from a database and stores them in their relevant folders on the C drive on a local machine. At the moment, every time I run the console app, it pulls ALL the files from the database. What I would like to be able to do, is each time I run it, It only pulls the files that were submitted since I last ran the console application. Currently, this is the linq statement that pulls the files from the database.

I have a VB.NET MDI WinForms app. My users have been complaining about form creep (as they call it), this is where each time you open a specific form within the main MDI window it opens slightly below and to the right of the location it loaded previously - i.e. it starts in the top left of the window and works its way down to the bottom right. I have to agree with them that this is extremely irritating, is there any way to prevent this?

The question on how to check input for validity is answered numerous times! You just check whether the stream is in a good state. If not, you'll reset the stream and ignore the character.

The length of a Python Unicode string in a narrow-Unicode build is the number of UTF-16 *code units*, not actual Unicode code points. Truncating and other slicing options that go by arbitrary index can indeed split a surrogate pair in half, with the result of some missing/replaced characters. On a narrow build, `unichr(0x10345)` simply fails; `len(u'\U00010345')` is `2`. This is the price you pay for easy interaction with Win32 UTF-16LE APIs. Most other environments use UCS-4 which doesn't suffer from any such problem.	0	0

This is a method in Java, that(when k == 0) in int[] arr has one of k-combination int[] intems. In variable iloczyn is calculated product of elements in this combination. In tmp is calculated sum of all such products. Unfortunately, System.out.println(tmp) shows, that when function ends, tmp equals 0. This is very sad, because i need this variable for next calculations. What shoud I do?	0	0

I assume you're using Ken Reitz's excellent requests library to do the HTTP requests (if not, you really should be!)Most likely, the problem is that requests doesn't add a 'Content-type' header to multi-part uploads, and packmgr doesn't read multi-part bodies with no 'Content-type' header. So, while a normal 'requests' POST of a multipart-encoded file would go something like this: you instead have to use the longer form, setting an explicit content-type: Note that one side-effect of doing it this way is that it cannot stream the file - the entire package ZIP file will be read into memory.	0	0

When contributing to a very old, and apparently no longer maintained, open-source or public domain project, is it suggested practice to follow the original author's coding style even if it is terrible?

I have a somewhat complicated issue. I have a grid defined (using the Struts2-JQuery Grid Plugin). One of the columns has a custom formatter that calls a Javascript function to put a button into that column. (Note: I absolutely HATE doing it that way). The point of the button is to open up a dialog box. This dialog box contains a checkboxlist, which can't be rendered in the grid. Somehow, I need to pass a parameter to the action that returns the view that will be displayed inside the dialog. Since this is somewhat complex, here is the code: Grid definition: Javascript Custom Formatter: Dialog Definition: Remote Manage Roles JSP (trimmed): Since I get the id of the grid object via javascript, but use the JSP taglib for the dialog, how can I pass the id around?	0	0

I have an .ico file with 5 icon sizes embedded in it being used as the main application icon and the System Tray icon. When it shows up in the task bar the icon is using the 16x16 format which is desired. When the icon shows up in the Notification Area/System tray, it is using the 32x32 format and Windows is rendering it down to a 16x16 icon, which looks horrible. How do I force windows to use the 16x16 icon size in the notification area? Here's my code to put the icon in the system tray:	1	0

I am looking at moving my company's internal business app from VB.NET to PHP. Some of the people were worried about losing GUI features that can be found in .NET. I am under the impression that with the right javascript framework, anything in .NET GUI can be replicated. While I am still researching this point, I would like to ask if form features in .NET GUI can in fact be replicated with javascript and slightly more importantly, will it take much longer to develop to get the same results?	1	0

`ROW_NUMBER()` paging emulation, or SQL Server 2012's `OFFSET .. FETCH` clause can be quite slow for high page numbers: http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/webtech/042606-1.shtml.

I've been using a custom function for some time now to prevent clickjacking on certain sites. However, I've been surprised to find there's not a lot out there about how to do this 'idiomatically' using the various popular JavaScript frameworks.
