I used the same approach as Chris Wenham. Under load, performance suffers because new NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs need to be allocated for each Enqueue/Dequeue.

In the Dequeue, send args with NotifyCollectionChangedAction.Remove, the item removed, and index 0.	0	0

I think your best bet is to drop the idea of wrapping the array in a structure, bite the bullet and allocate a 2D array yourself.This will mean that you need to do explicit indexing, but that would have to happen under the hood anyway.When it comes to alignment, if you're going to visit every array elements in each of the arrays, it probably doesn't matter, it's better to make them compact to maximize use of cache.Something like: Then to index, just do: If you're very worried about that multiplication, use a temporary pointer. After profiling it, of course.Sometimes you see this done with a helper macro to do the indexing: then you can write the final line as: it's a bit clumsy since the needs to go in there all the time, of course.	0	0

With regard to Peter Lawrey's note that you don't need instanceof for final classes and can just use a reference equality, be careful! Even though the final classes cannot be extended, they are not guaranteed to be loaded by the same classloader.

MySQL is extremely cheap when you have the distro (or staff to build) that carries MySQL Enterprise edition. This is a High Availability version which offers multi-master replication over many servers. Pros are low (license-) costs after initial purchase of hardware (Gigs of RAM needed!) and time to set up. The drawbacks are suboptimal performance with many joins, no full-text indexing, stored procesures (I think) and one need to replicate grants to every master node. Yet it's easier to run than the replication/proxy balancing setup that's available for PostgreSQL.	0	0

I think that's absolutely terrible practice. First of all you do not need to make the trip to the server to hide and show controls, unless you need new data. Second, any decent javascript framework will allow you to hide show controls based on the control's id, class name, or whatever css selector. Moreover using a javascript post/get to a generic handler will give you the data that you need without the postback. I'd suggest using JQuery, or some other alternative.	0	0

Suggest adding the following to Peek and Pop(): if ((_stack.Count - 1) < 0) throw new Exception("Cannot Peek or Pop without first doing a Push.");. This would alert the programmer to this corner case, and allow them to keep it in mind when using this class. We could also add a TryPeek or TryPop, which is the approach Microsoft have taken with their ConcurrentDictionary implementations.	0	0

I have just about finished adding all of the content to each page of my website. I've noticed, however, when I navigate between links some of the pages shift to the right about 10 px or so. This is extremely irritating. All of my pages are contained within the same container using a fluid grid. However, not all pages have the same amount of content. I noticed that pages with empty divs don't shift when I navigate between them. However, if I navigate from a page with content to a page with little or no content, I see the shift. Should this be happening if all of my pages are using the same container, same fluid grid? Does this make sense? Can you sense my desperation?	0	0

First: I like your approach of being concentrated on a clean and proper state handling of your application.Excellent! But, as you said: Android can kill activities and manage their lifecycle for itself. The OS may release memory allocated for your activity as soon as possible requiring you to allocate it again. This means your fragment may or may not get destroyed. As you can see in your stack trace, FragmentActivity.onCreate is called.This obviously inddicates your existing resources created within the context of the old activity are not access - able anymore. The only context that is guaranted to exist through your application lifecycle is the application context. For all other resources you should be aware and handle properly that created resources may be invalid at the time you are trying to access them.	0	0

It's generally better to keep them open.

I'm doing one app which requires AJAX call on almost every user interaction possible, I started writing JS functions, webservices etc. to handle all of that(still long way to go from here). Now I am wondering If I made a mistake maybe I should put whole page in update panel because I really hate writting JS. Is there some drawback to use it instead of custom written ajax calls to web service and js functions, and is it better to use more update panels or one big?	0	0

In VB.NET 4.0, most of you probably know you don't need to explicitly write getters and setters for your Property declarations as follows: VB automatically creates private member variables called _Foo and _Foo2.

I'm pretty new to Angular but loving it! I am trying to create a modal dialog to display a partial view. ui.bootstap.modal has an option which takes the URL to the partial view to be displayed.

So in my controller I'm attempting to open the modal dialog like so: The modal dialog opens but the contents are just . Do I need to define the route on the server side or can I use Angular routing to return the partial? Thanks!	0	0

How do I stop a browser refresh from happening when a flash object has focus inside a pop up window? Yes, I abhor pop up windows too. Yet we have a flash questionnaire that is being wrecked from users who use refresh.

I have access to the Flash through our Flash developer, but he is uncertain of how to do this. The closest we could come up with was to use the fscommand trapallkeys, yet it does not appear to be working.	0	0

I don't think you want this - if I'm typing a document into Word and I hit K, I'm going to be very angry when your application pops up instead of a "k" appearing in my document. Windows allows you to assign shortcut keys to an icon on the desktop, but it limits them to the function keys or to combinations containing both Alt and Ctrl. Right-click on a desktop icon and go to Properties, and look for the field marked "Shortcut key".	0	0

No, definitely not return "object" ! WCF should make use of DataContracts and define full implementations of the request and possibly response objects for each call. See these two excellent articles on Datacontract basics: I have no idea why the developers of those services picked "object" as the return type - doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me! Marc	0	0

I'm convinced that this is a combination of Windows and Vcl issues. If I understand correctly, Vcl is using outdated Windows API calls for printers, which leads to these issues.

If the Vcl were upgraded to use the newer methods, this problem presumably wouldn't happen. At least this is my hunch.	0	0

(I'm assuming you don't have a DMR.)There is no easy/clean way to do this in Cognos. In your query, you'll have to build a calculation for each year in your output. So, something like this for 2013: And basically the same for 2014.Cut the Trans piece out of your crossab. Then you'll nest those two calcs under your years. To get rid of all the zeroes or nulls, select the two columns. From the menu, select , , .Finally, you will drop a calc in next to your Years in the crosstab (not under them). The expression will be (or whatever you end up naming your calcs). Format it as a percent, and you should be good to go.Told you it was a pain!	0	0

Oh, this was was a pain! I probably lost 2 hours on this. Here is the solution: CMake uses short 'C' applications to test/try things.

The solution was to change the first line of CMakeLists from this: ...to include C as a language: Then delete , recreate it, and everything then works:	0	0

@Rob, the only thing `onclick` should be intended to do is be taken out back and shot.

I have an Android app that looks absolutely horrible if the user sets their font size to large or extra large (via Settings -> Display -> Font size in Ice Cream Sandwich). It just plain wasn't designed for variable font sizes, and it makes a lot of the text unreadable. I've seen applications that preserve the font size for most views, so I know that there has to be a way to do this. Is there a simple way for me to tell the application to ignore the user's font size preference? And if there isn't, how would you suggest that I go about calculating the font sizes? If nothing else, is there a way for me to retrieve the user's font size preference?	0	0

Firstly, that's not how works. You have to specify constants for each , and those constants will be compared to the expression in parentheses (in your case, ). That is how works, period. Secondly, switch is not faster than several s And thirdly, you shouldn't really worry about miniscule performance optimizations when you're dealing with javascript.	0	0
