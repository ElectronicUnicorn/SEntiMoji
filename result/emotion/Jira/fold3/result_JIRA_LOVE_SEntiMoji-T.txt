If you're ok with that, I think another jira should switch the parser.	0	0
export with no args prints all the current settings.	0	0
Without having a mathematical prove, I nevertheless suppose it could disturb parameters of generation if we have non Gaussian empirical data.	0	0
I agree there's a bug, I just want to ensure any change still works correctly when CURRENT_USER name is passed in.	0	0
Thanks Ilya.	1	1
I don't however see that it follows that we should provide implementations of file formats with a large number of different serialization systems, as that invites multiplicative long-term support issues.	0	0
I still find the difference puzzling -- I can't justify your version being 3x faster.	0	0
i suggest that we commit this ASAP and then do the work to fix the build once the code is in subversion.	0	0

martin-g :i think do this in 6.0 and do 4327 in 1.5.x as its very easy to do 4327,if you do 4327,there will not be any need to mock AjaxRequestTarget but if you do do 4327 also add getters for prependscripts and appendscripts in ART ;)	0	0

The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure - there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki -namespace (with no subpackages), but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier.	0	0
