Ok cool, this is just a matter of adding strings to the various [NotFound()|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L160] returns in files.cppThere are a number of error cases in the [browse|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] and [read|https://github.com/apache/mesos/blob/0.15.0-rc4/src/files/files.cpp#L204] endpoints, I'd imagine one could change the javascript to generate bad requests which should be sufficient to test this :)	0	1

The file has Unix line endings though ...@Lukas: scpexe works for me with M2 despite the fact that it insists on a key even if an agent is running (WAGON-27).	0	0
Note that if you swap the key order, then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String, SchemaDescriptor)o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors, one for each column in the table.	0	0
