I guess the obvious thing to do is to go in and reconfigure the pagination so it doesn't (paginate), but if we had the ability to add items to existing POs then you could still use the pagination mechanism and build up the PO page-by-page (quite handy if your working through  your POs during less busy times of the day).	0	0
