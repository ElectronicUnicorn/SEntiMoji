What you can do is trying this request with a different browser when the server is suppose to hang, and also try to do another request when the serveur is supposed to be hang to see if it's not a pb with the PDU length ( what I suspect is that when trying to decode this request, the decoder is waiting for more bytes so wait ad vitam aeternam ...)
