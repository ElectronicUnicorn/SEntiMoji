Probably it is way deeper problem.	0	0
I did some more messing around, and I was wrong about the FS stuff.	0	0
If we had this in place, I think it would help with the migration to this new way of doing the meta because as is, the region name in fs is a hash of regionname... changing the format of the regionname would mean we generate a different hash... so we'd need hbase-2531 to be in place before we could do this change.	0	0

Can you attach the WSDL /XSD files that created the problem ?	0	0
Dojo [0] and Ext.js [1] take both a different approach (which i personally don't really like).	0	0
It signifies 10% of generated values will be __fixed_ values - their respective bin means!	0	0

I mistakenly thought 10.9 was supposed to work on Java 1.4 (in fact, the 10.9.1 release notes say it is supported, although we removed support for it after 10.8), and the build worked in my environment because I had j14lib set, and the test ran just fine on 1.4.	0	0
