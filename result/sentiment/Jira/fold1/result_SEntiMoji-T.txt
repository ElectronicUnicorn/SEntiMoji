"Well  since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did.  First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area.  One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class, when you turn on caching in this transformer, the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.  Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself, then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then that does not make much sense to me.  Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need, no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it.  I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects."	0	0

"Hi Michael  thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.  I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.  I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)). Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist, because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).  My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check). Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like  ... if (manager.getCopyNew()) { int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length]; for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++) fields[i] = i; newInstance.pcCopyFields(pc, fields); } ...  This solution works for my testcase.  As an alternative you can modify (or add an additional) newInstance to copy the data.  I have no real experience with OpenJPA. Perhaps there is a much better solution. "	0	1

"{quote} This wasn't a problem with my patch, right?  That was an issue of the mahout script in trunk itself? {quote}  Yes it was a problem with the script in trunk. I believe this was due to the fact that the job files were on the classpath instead of all of the dependency jars. Adding the job files to the classpath does not add the dependency jars they contain to the classpath as well. So, no you didn't add this, but it should be fixed (and is in the patch)  {quote} What is the -core option for?  I've never used it, how does it work? {quote}  when you're running bin/mahout in the context of a build the -core option is used to tell it to use the build classpath instead of the classpath used for a binary release. This just follows the pattern established (by Doug?) in the hadoop and nutch launch scripts.  {quote} Also added a help message for the 'run' argument. {quote}  near line 72 in bin/mahout: (this is different from the --help question I had)  {code} echo ""  seq2sparse            generate sparse vectors from a sequence file"" echo ""  vectordump            dump vectors from a sequence file"" echo ""  run                   run mahout tasks using the MahoutDriver, see: http://cwiki.apache.org/MAHOUT/mahoutdriver.html"" {code}  {quote} So you already added the ability to load via classpath, right? If we merge that way of thinking with what I'm currently working on (having a configurable ""MAHOUT_CONF_DIR"" which is used for all these props files), we could just have the mahout shell script just add MAHOUT_CONF_DIR to the classpath (the way you already have it adding the hardwired core/src/main/resources directory) and then it would work that way. {quote}  Yep, that should do it, as long as MAHOUT_CONF_DIR appears before src/main/resources, we should be good to go. It should be added outside of the section of the script that determines if -core has been specified on the command-line.  "	0	0

"Hi Ivan   {quote} + long numberOfEntriesToReplicate = lastEntryId - firstEntryId; should be (lastEntryId - firstEntryId) + 1 {quote} You are right, both side entries has to be considered. Thank a lot for noticing it.  {quote} In general, I think this splitting should be in LedgerFragmentReplicator, rather than BookKeeperAdmin. This way you could avoid the need to expose the update of ledger metadata. It will make control flow a little more complex as you'll have to initiate replication on the next subfragment from the callback of the current, but i think it would encapsulate things a bit better. {quote} Yes, in general, all the split logic should be in LFR. I might pushed that code to BKAdmin because, I don't want to disturb admin key flow much, which will go through LFR. Now anyway, I moved that logic, still not disturbing BKAdmin key flows in anyway.  Attached a patch, which addresses the comments.  Also to give more confidence on split fragment scenarios, I have added multiple boundary cases for FragmentSplit.

"Yes  bytes + comparator would work fine for jaql.  Preferably  it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code  which work on serialized bytes (but also on WritableComparables  so that might be a problem).  If these comparators are inconsistent  then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly.  I think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement  but I don't see how you can enforce it in any way.  Different key types are fine  as long as the comparator knows how to handle them.  If you can't reuse the same comparator interface  I can always implement my comparisons in another place  but I already have two of them (one in the WritableComparable  and one in the Comparator).  I don't see how column families and the key comparator are related, except that they are both table-level metadata. Yes, I agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table. "	0	0

"@JMS & @stack Tks for your review and commtents, my reply as follows... bq.Have you tried it? Does it works for you? Yes, I've tested it in our env. and works well {quote} Is this required? {code} executor = null; {code} {quote} My intention was to set _executor_ explicitly if the call path is _main -> HbaseFsck -> initialPoolNumThreads -> run -> initialPoolNumThreads_, despite it should be no hurt if I remove this statement.  {quote} What JMS said (down to his +1). When you set exec = 0, it makes me wonder if it would ever be non-null and if so, should it be shutdown before you make a new one? But maybe this is an impossible state. {quote} Tks for stack's suggestion !! this way is more safer if any unexpected call happens. So I changed the code snippet into following style. How do you think about this ? {code} 288 if (executor != null) { 289      executor.shutdown(); 290      executor = null; 291 } {code}  bq.Can you do a trunk version to run hadoopqa?

"> Have checked in this change which can be reviewed here: http://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/click/?cs=766349  > Would appreciate any feedback. I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads. Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases, I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it. I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).  Of course, I'm a newbie, but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed), not with Click?  Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice, but this one is not. Making it even more complex, is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.  From what I saw, one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however, Click should remain very simple, otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford ""published"" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility, so ""experiments"" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )  My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that ""black box feeling"" - and it's not fun ). I think like this, are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :). "	1	1

"Vishal Kher to Benjamin  Camille  9:38 AM (54 minutes ago)  Hi Ben,  I was going to open a jira after checking with you guys.  With your solution won't we run in into the problem that Camille pointed out by marking the snapshot for lastZxid - 1? - Peer fails after taking the snapshot. The snapshot has applied lastZxid, which created a child znode. During recovery it will apply lastZxid, which will faill with NodeExists and we will increment the Cversion of the parent (after fix for ZOOKEEPER-1046). So creation of sequential znodes won't be be really sequential. This is probably acceptable, but should be clearly documented. If not, then from this bug, it looks to me that patch ZOOKEEPER-1046 was also not complete. We may need to conditionally update cversion.  I think we need a clear document of how snapshots are supposed to work and what to assume while taking snapshots and while recovering from snapshots. It will be very helpful for to verify the correctness of implementation and for future bug fixes.I will open a jira for this bug shortly and post our discussion as well.  Thanks.  -Vishal  "	0	1

I haven't looked in trunk yet.  The Lucene.Net_4e branch should have a already have a snk. I could add the same snk file to trunk and the 2.9.4 branch when I go add the build scripts to the trunk this weekend, so that all the branches are building strong assemblies.  Someone would still need to go back to the tag and create a 2.9.2 version using the snk whenever the next release does come out. "	0	0
"If this is deemed to be a valid bug  you can use my upcoming patch which simply doesn't pass the calls to getLoginTimeout and setLoginTimeout through to the BasicDataSource.  I guess it could be a good thing to let the BasicDataSource throw the UnsupportedOperationException notifying the programmer that their call to the method really isn't doing anything.  OTOH, they probably care more about successfully migrating their 1.0.2 app to 1.1 and this is just getting in the way. If they really want to know why their call to setLoginTimeout isn't working they can check the included javadoc.  So, if you decide it's a bug then there's a patch coming..."	0	0

"Hi Roman   Which version of Servicemix are you using ? There is an camel feature (which includes camel-core, camel-spring and camel-osgi) in the org.apache.felix.karaf.features.cfg, you need to replace it with camel-core and camel-spring-osgi. Please make sure there is no camel-spring, camel-spring-osgi, camel-osgi installed at the same time.  "	0	0

"The patch looks good  and so do the tests.  Thanks.

"bq. CASSANDRA-2444 got in the way  I'm not sure what the right solution is here.  I buy the premise of 2444 that you don't necessarily want to get hammered by compaction when you're first starting up (warming up caches).  So I don't think ""check for compactions ever N seconds"" is a great policy.  But, I'm not sure ""check every N seconds, starting M minutes after startup"" is great either because it's not something a user will just guess when he's wondering ""why aren't compactions happening yet?""  Any other ideas?"	0	0
