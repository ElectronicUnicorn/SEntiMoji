I tried to reproduce it on HP-UX as well but I failed. Crafting my own allocator did not help. I have spent a couple of hours on it and I am sorry I cannot spend more time to shed some more light.  All builds on all platforms with all compilers exhibit failures in the same tests in the same place.

"I apologize for taking so long to get to reviewing this.  This has some good elements but also quite a few problems.  Here are a few suggestions.  1. The bindingGBeans do not need to know the name of the gbean they are getting something to bind into jndi from, they need a reference to it.  Similarly they do not need to bind a naming Reference, they can bind the object itself.  For instance, the connector binding gbean can do something like this:  private final ManagedConnectionFactoryWrapper managedConnectionFactoryWrapper; // this is the reference to the gbean that gives us the connection factory to bind  ...  //now it's time to bind the connection factory  Object connectionFactory = managedConnectionFactoryWrapper.$getResource(); globalContext.bind(jndiName, connectionFactory);  This is also going to affect how the builders set up the binding gbeans: they know the name of the appropriate gbean such as managedConnectionFactoryWrapper, since they just created it, so they need to use that name to set the reference pattern in the binding gbean.  The binding gbean will then get (a proxy to) the ""real"" gbean that it can use as outlined above.  2. I don't see an implementation of a writable thread safe jndi Context, as dain pointed out you would need.  3. The zip file consists almost entirely of irrelevant files and the actual source files do not all appear to be in the geronimo project structure.  This makes it extremely hard to figure out what to look at.  4. Some of the code modifications (such as to ServiceConfigBuilder) appear to be test cases rather than production code.  It will be a lot easier to evaluate your work if you keep test cases and production code clearly separated as is done in typical maven projects.  5. I think you will need to redo the openejb work after dain's reintegration of his container rewrite.  Thanks!  Let us know if you have any questions about this."	['null ', '-1']	1

"Hi Fuhwei   I was a bit worried by the big override method in your patch, so I have taken a good long look at this, but as its an area of the code I'm not very familiar with I can't necessarily jump in with an expert comment.  My current analysis of this is that EMF forces an assumption in the two lines of XSDEcoreBuilder's createFeature method  XSDTypeDefinition elementTypeDefinition = getEffectiveTypeDefinition(xsdComponent, xsdElementDeclaration); EClassifier eClassifier = getEClassifier(elementTypeDefinition);  that the type of an element is contained in the emf representation generated from the input schema.  So, if we could override getEffectiveTypeDefinition and conditionally return an XSDTypeDefinition from the metadata available within our SDO scope then we would be OK.  For the case where the type referenced in the schema was provided by an earlier XSD to SDO conversion I think we can retrieve this data, and then do whatever's necessary, if anything, to get the EClassifier based on that type definition (I haven't spent the time to dig into that as I thought now was a good time to discuss)  This wouldn't cover the case where a schema writer was assuming some types were available that hadn't been produced from an XSD,  but I don't know that that's currently a realistic use case.  If my analysis is correct we could lobby EMF to make a change so that the above two lines were incorporated into a single protected method call that didn't require the EClassifier lookup to proceed via an XSDTypeDefinition instance. Then our override would be able to return an EClassifier based on the xsdComponent and xsdElementDeclaration directly.  What do you think?  Have I missed a/the point here? "	['null ', '1']	0

"Truth is that  the sheer size of CFStore (over 2K line) annoys me. I think this prove CFStore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation. So I tried to make DataTracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. I'm not claiming it's perfect  but I really don't think that CFStore is our most beautiful class in there and I do believe that DataTracker improves this a bit.  But there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there, fine, I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker. I would however be more reluctant to remove DataTracker altogether and put the AtomicReference in CFStore. Because this would move all the CAS related logic in CFStore and seriously there is already too much stuff in CFStore. My humble opinion though. "	['null ', '0']	0

"> Do you think attached patch is generic?  Nothing is generic until it's used in more than one place.  The above isn't complete (it needs, e.g., 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[], int, int) and seek(long)?  It also assumes a particular checksum implementation, CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others, that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.  But I think we should probably skip that this iteration. "	['null ', '1']	0

"John: first off  i want to apologize for the *extremely* belated patch review ... I know i told you i'd try to look at this months ago  but ... yeah ... life tends to get in the way of patches.  on the whole, things seem pretty good -- although you were still using an interface instead of an abstract class.  Having the main API for a type of plugin be an abstract class is an important mechanism to help future proof ourselves against possible additions we want to make the the plugin API in the future; if it's an interface we can't really change it once it's released (because we might break people Impls); if it's an abstract class, we can always provide a default impl for people.  the biggest concern i have about this patch at the moment is that there are no tests, and no example configs, so it's hard to be sure it's even working at all :)  here's what i see as the current todo list for this issue...  1) there are some legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors that need to delegate to the SolrCore to get indexReaderFactory ... perhaps we should have a helper method that decides which SolrIndexConfig to use based on the ""name"" ? 2) we need tests showing custom IndexReaderFactory getting used (even if it's just a mock IndexReaderFactory thatsets a boolean to show it's being used) ... this will also serve as a test that config syntax works. 3) need commented out example of using a custom indexReaderFactory in example/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml 4) sanity check this against SOLR-465, make sure we aren't painting ourselves into a corner. 5) we should make IndexReaderFactory use the AbstractPluginLoader stuff and remove the guts of SolrIndexConfig.loadIndexReaderFactory.  It looks like we'll need to add a ""single item"" version of load to the AbstractPluginLoader to make that work well.  #5 is something that can be done after this is committed, but 1-4 are pretty important.  If you can update the patch with some configs/tests i'll think about the legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors and try to figure out a good solution for them "	['null ', '-1']	1
"Patch looks great!  Thanks Artem.  No more mixing in of fuzzy-ness into AnalyzingSuggester.  It looks like we are doing the utf8 conversion + det twice per lookup, once in convertAutomaton and once in getFullPrefixPaths.  But, I think this is inevitable: the first conversion is on the ""straight"" automaton, for exactFirst match, and the second one is on the lev automaton, for non-exactFirst.  Really we should only do the first convertAutomaton if exactFirst is true ... but this is an optimization so we don't need to fix it now. "	['null ', '1']	1

"It'd work but it's a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in 0.92.  My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production.  But I'm fine implementing the halfway fix if my argument still doesn't win you over :)"	['null ', '1']	0
