OK, thanks.  The approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want.   When auto-detecting everything, this patch is better on non-AVX hardware that happens to have RDTSCP. Otherwise, they effectively work the same.  When compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes, this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun. That might mean they go hunting for docs twice, unless they find the new install guide section. At least we don't fail mysteriously any more!  When compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes, both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c "You, too, could be using RDTSCP!". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork, though.  I was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases (build host is old, user knows they have AVX on the compute nodes, so they know to set SIMD and don't know RDTSCP exists / is relevant), but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough.  So I'm happy to adopt this solution. Thanks! Shall I abandon my patch, send reviewers here, and one of us work on Erik's feedback and/or the new nag? If we add the nag, commit message needs updating.	0.0	0.0

well, since we're doing this, might as well do this instead, since it's cleaner and looks better (and sanitized).          elements = getattr(self._conn, class_name)(ElementName=element_name)         data = self._get_first_item(elements)  And before you dismiss the usage of getattr, That's actually how wmi namespaces work: the __getattr__ method is overriden and it will lookup and cache that class_name and return it, as it does not have it defined.

On second sought: actually you don't need this file (endpoint) at all. We have already POST /changes that creates a change and what are you doing here is to delegate to its apply() method, after translating your own Input to ChangeInfo. The only reason to have this class is to get the UiAction for granted (Guice DynamicItem binding and discovery).  But you could solve this in different way: just construct UiAction on you own in ProjectJson and add it to actions map manually. See an example how it's done in InlineEdit series: [1]. Now, on the client side, from your custom UiAction you can invoke the original REST endpoint: POST /changes. The only difference to current solution: you would need to pass project name too, obviously.  This also raises the question do we want to have this button on project info screen at all? We could add it to main page (or may be just add a keyboard shortcut), in wich case we are not in project context any more and the dialog must be extended to provide project name (with suggestion oracle for project, like it already does for branches).  I don't have strong preference for one of these solutions. So, you can let it as is for now and wait for opinion of other reveiwers.

Yikes, we are starting an RPC for every row in the table?  My concern with this is the browser can only issue 4 requests at a time to the server.  If a user has 50 items in their dashboard, which many do, this will take quite a few round-trips (13!) to completely load the status codes.  Worse, if the user navigates away before they are completely done loading, they will continue to load, as there is no way to cancel the queued RPCs.  I would prefer having myApprovals and strongestApprovals take a Set<Change.Id> and return a Map<Change.Id, Whatever>, and make only one call to each method for the dashboard.	0.0	0.0

If you dig into the code, at some point you will reach a very strange statement (a couple of calls from setCacheSize), qMax(qMin(.....), 25).

I think that this class makes more sense than the Branch class because there are several places in Gerrit where refs strings are manipulated without using Branch objects.  Jgit does define some of those constants, but we cannot use jgit everywhere, particularly in GWT, which I suspect is why this class is here in the first place.  We need a good place in Gerrit for these constants, and the Branch object itself is a much higher level object than this simple class (it isn't only about refs, but rather refs and projects).  These constants feel  more appropriate here to me than in the Branch class.  I have some more changes, which I will push, which move them out of the Branch class completely.  I am willing to update the comment here if need be, but this class feels appropriate to me (based on its name and location) and I don't think that "naive" comment should get in the way of that.	-1.0	0.0

Removing onboard devices instead of setting them to off can break the chipset configuration.

while you're at it, would it make sense to fill in the remaining cases? Desktop, Music, Movies, Pictures, etc...  the implementations which can be supported using a virtual file system (i.e. media types, as long as the permission is set in the manifest) can be added later, but having the cases here already seems reasonable	0.0	0.0
You may want to check for NULL because cbmem allocations can fail.	0.0	0.0
Make sure the smbus code is compiled and linked in.	0.0	0.0
presentation::AnimationEffect aEffect = presentation::AnimationEffect_NONE;	0.0	0.0
Sounds like it should be disabled. It is reasonable to run a whole multi-sim workflow (em, equil phases, simulate) in the same set of multi-dirs, so being able to use   mdrun_mpi -multidir the-dirs* -deffnm equil-npt  would be a nice thing. I haven't tried -multidir with a non-default equil-npt that I remember though.  Should we be looking at doing the directory change for -multidir earlier than we do?	0.0	0.0
Note that these can be usually written simpler as just "" instead of OUString().	0.0	0.0
I guess this must be an unsigned integer because of the way we shift bits in the next file. However, in that case the width too is likely important, and I would suggest using gmx_uint32_t for clarity.	0.0	0.0
You're right. Ivan,tenant_id is non-admin tenant need to change to admin tennt id here. will fix it in next patch.	0.0	0.0
change the error message to reflect that key size is big.	0.0	0.0
Why are we allowing calls to non-existent functions?	-1.0	-1.0
setPageTitle() takes a Message, so no need to change anything here.	0.0	0.0
