"bq. Actually  DIH started as a standalone webapp inside AOL. We changed it because we didn't want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in Solr installations.  Another web app means you need to procure hardware  plan capacity/failover  create firewall holes etc  Even if it were a standalone app, I would still run it on the same hardware that runs Solr, though I might run it on the secondary servers that aren't normally seeing query load.  Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names, because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't, I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client, which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema.  bq. Talking to multiple collections was never a goal for DIH – I'm not sure what value it will bring.  I've got a sharded index; currently production is on version 3.5.0.  Full rebuilds are done with DIH because my SolrJ application can't touch it for indexing speed.  It does fine for keeping the index up to date with once-a-minute updates, but for indexing millions of documents per shard, DIH beats it handily even though it's only single-threaded.  If I could put all the DIH stuff into one central place, it might make it easier to manage.  I do intend to look at the DIH code to see how it manages to run so fast, so I can hopefully improve my own code, but I can never find the time. "	0	0

"Hi Guillaume   I think that what you are saying is right and i find ( despite is on the specification or not ) that to have the error status is quite useful.  But i don't agree that if InOnly MEP terminate with an ERROR status it should propagated back.  I agree totally with Gianfranco this should be done only when we're working in sync mode, otherwise it's better not to propagate the error back and use feature like restart from the failure point, that we've just implemeted.

"bq. Hmmm  infoStream is just for debugging... should we really make it volatile?  I'll remove its volatile...  {quote} bq. IWC cannot be made immutable – you build it up incrementally (new IWC(...).setThis(...).setThat(...)). Its fields cannot be final.  Setters can return modified immutable copy of 'this'. So you get both incremental building and immutability. {quote}  Oh yeah.  But then we'd clone the full IWC on every set... this seems like overkill in the name of ""purity"".  {quote} What about earlier compromise mentioned by Shay, Mark, me? Keep setters for 'live' properties on IW. This clearly draws the line, and you don't have to consult Javadocs for each and every setting to know if you can change it live or not. {quote}  I really don't like that this approach would split IW configuration into two places.  Like you look at the javadocs for IWC and think that you cannot change the RAM buffer size.  IWC should be the one place you go to see which settings you can change about the IW.  That some of these settings take effect ""live"" while others do not is really an orthogonal (and I think, secondary, ie handled fine w/ jdocs) aspect/concern. "	0	0

"Thanks Dawid.  bq. Yes, this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did, albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).  bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard – I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.  Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)  bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst – wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted, this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already, ehm, a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First, I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data, eg inCount, newAddress, etc.  That required making the first pass FST ""modal"" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<Int,X>) I think?  Second, the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading, ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack), and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading, and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord, write-non-ord, read-packed, read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).  "	1	1

"I think my first preference  would be to make this only a java 7 and up feature. The change is very clear and we can use our normal testing methods.  Meanwhile users can set their umask appropriately.  My second preference would be only  to only change permissions by default  with java 7 and higher. I think we really need to have tests for the default configuration and non-portable tests might have to be customized to different environments, which seems like a lot of effort for something that won't be used moving forward.  I am sorry I didn't chime in earlier.  Time has been quite tight recently. "	-1	-1

"Some thoughts I had about this:  Overall, I think it's a good idea.  Seems like it's not crazy to add and would have multiple benefits.  Logical striping across the L1 boundary is a simple solution to both proactively handle splits and reduce compaction times.  Thoughts on this feature 1. Fixed configs : in the same way that we got a lot of stability by limiting the regions/server to a fixed number, we might want to similarly limit the number of stripes per region to 10 (or X) instead of ""every Y bytes"".  This will help us understand the benefit we get from striping and it's easy to double the striping and chart the difference. 2. NameNode pressure :  Obviously, a 10x striping factor will cause 10x scaling of the FS.  Can we offset this by increasing the HDFS block size, since addBlock dominates at scale?  Really, unlike Hadoop, you have all of the HFile or none of it.  Missing a portion of the HFile currently invalidates the whole file.  You really need 1 HDFS block == 1 HFile.  However, we could probably just toy with increasing it by the striping factor right now and seeing if that balances things. 3. Open Times : I think this will be an issue, specifically on server start.  Need to be careful here. 4. Major compaction : you can perform a major compaction (remove deletes) as long as you have [i,end) contiguous.  I don't think you'd need to involve L0 files in an MC at all.  Save the complexity.  Furthermore, part of the reason why we created the tiered compaction is to prevent small/new files from participating in MC because of cache thrashing, poor minor compactions, and a handful of other reasons.  So, some thoughts on related pain points we seem to have that tie into this feature: 1. Reduce Cache thrashing : region moves kill us a lot of time because we have a cold cache.  There is a worry that more aggressive compactions mean more thrashing.  I think it will actual even this out better since right now a MC causes a lot of churn.  Just should be thinking about this if perf after the feature isn't what we desire. 2. Unnecessary IOPS : outside of this algorithm, we should just completely get rid of the requirement to compact after a split.  We have the block cache, so given a [start,end) in the file, we can easily tell our mid point for future splits.  There's little reason to aggressively churn in this way after splitting. 3. Poor locality : for grid topology setups, we should eventually make the striping algorithm a little more intelligent about picking our replicas.  If all stripes go to the same secondary & tertiary node, then splits have a very restricted set of servers to chose for datanode locality. "	0	1

I thought that staticJavascript purpose was to allow things like:  <script src=""<html:rewrite page='/staticJs.jsp' />"" type=""text/javascript""></script>  And create a jsp with something like:  <%@ page language=""java"" contentType=""text/javascript"" %> <%@ taglib uri=""struts-html"" prefix=""html"" %> <html:javascript dynamicJavascript=""false"" staticJavascript=""true"" />  And take profit of browsers cache.  No this is broken. As a workaround  <jsp:include page=""/staticJs.jsp"" flush=""true"" />  can be used, but this hasn't any benefint over generating both static and dynamic javascript in the same tag (except form multiple forms per page)   If this is the intended behaviour I'm sorry for reopenning the bug.

"Hi Neil  Thanks for the advice ...  > On the other hand, if you can design a handler that knows how to > make appropriate calls to the scanner's sendChars() method so that > the buffer gets flushed when a maximum buffer size is reached, then > perhaps a pluggable handler wouldn't be necessary since the default > behaviour would always work when an application has chosen to set > this limit.  The code I have, as written, does have the pluggable handler notion, since I didn't want to arbitrarily couple the XMLBuffer class implementation (or worse, it's interface) to the scanner. I didn't go so overboard as to allow multiple registered handlers, or anything like that; this seemed simple enough without being a hack.  > I'd also observe that XMLBuffer has to check to use the > infelicitously named ""insureCapacity()"" method to make sure it's > large enough  Yes, this is where I implemented the full-handler invocation. It's more or less as you describe. Once I get everything cleaned up, I'll post the patch here; you'll probably find it to be entirely unsurprising.  I think what I'll end up doing to allow user-configurable buffer size limit will be to add a setter method on Parser and AbstractDOMParser, something like setInputBufferSize(). I think that would be most consistent with the existing API. Sound ok?"	1	1

"{quote} I don't think it makes sense to argue about who the exception messages are for [...] {quote}  I think the opposite, because it has an impact on the library design. Not that CM cannot go on with the current way; but my point is that Luc and you are focusing on top-level users while stressing that CM in a low-level component. To me, that is a blatant contradiction that produces drawbacks which I presented in several usage examples (which you didn't address), while you always reply with a single use case where the user is yourself (i.e. a CM developer). Anyone else who is using a high-level application based on CM will be baffled by the ""detailed exception message"" because, in all but the most trivial case, his actions will have only a remote connection to the exception triggered by CM. I'm pinpointing at a minute detail of the design of CM, explaining that it can come in the way of some direct users of CM. The current long list of errors is in fact imposing your view (of what is important) to future application developers. [As an example, let's say that someone wants to create a GUI (e.g. for the statistician referred to above), he will want to define his own detailed error messages to be displayed in the GUI with a formatting of his choice. The statistician will never see the messages created by CM.] If a CM exception (resulting from a precondition violation) reaches the end-user level, it means there was some unanticipated problem in the call chain. And to correct it, one would need more than just the ""detailed message"": the end-user will pass the stack trace to the application developer, who will correct a possible bug in his code (such as a missing check of a precondition) or pass it on the the CM developers.

"{quote} ...but even if we don't do that, i suppose it's also conceivable that someone might have their own Similarity implementation that is expensive to instantiate (ie: maintains some big in memory data structures?) and might want to be able to declare one instance and then refer to it by name in many different fieldType declarations. {quote}  I don't think this is really a use case we need to support: the purpose of Similarity today is to do term weighting, not to be a huge data-structure holder.  While I know Mike's original patch went this way with LUCENE-2392 (e.g. norms), I'm not sure i like it being in Similarity in the future either.  Otherwise concepts like lazy-loading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim, which is an awkward place (imagine if you have many fields).  So, I think we shouldn't really design for abuses of the API. If there are other use cases for ""named similarity"" that have to do with term weighting, I'm interested. "	0	0
