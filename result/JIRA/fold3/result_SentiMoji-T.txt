"I'm looking through DateTools now and can't help but want to clean it up some.  One thing I see that is odd is the use of a Calendar in timeToString(long resolution).  The first two lines look like this right now: {code} calInstance.setTimeInMillis(round(time, resolution)); Date date = calInstance.getTime(); {code}  Instead, it can simply be: {code} Date date = new Date(round(time, resolution)); {code}.  Secondly... I think a good deal of logic can be cleaned up in the other methods instead of a bunch of if-else statements that is a bad code smell.  Most of the logic of 3 of those methods could be put into Resolution and be made tighter."	0	0

Is there something else I need to do to cause the problem?  FYI - I created a Maven project with the code above as the only application. I then imported the application, which was a bit frustrating as it didn't seem to accomplish much. I then had to manually add the log4j 2 jars into the classpath along with target/classes and had to make a couple of other changes so that it knew how things were laid out in the project. I then ran the application from JDeveloper and it ran fine."	0	0

"Noah said he’s going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch  but I’d like to explain this for posterity.  make indeed throws this error, I didn’t suggest it is a grunt.js error, but it’s the way we use Autotools. In particular, in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:  FAUXTON_FILES = \ fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \ fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \ fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \ …and so on  In that list, there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js`, e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run, so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain, why this isn’t a make error. "	0	0

"Thanks a ton for your review  Todd. Here's an updated patch which addresses all of your comments except the following.  bq. In EditLogFileInputStream, why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress, that means we don't know the lastTxId, so it would be INVALID_TXID, right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS, we pass in INVALID_TXID, even though the log is not yet in progress.  I'm still working on producing an updated patch which also adds testing for the pending DN message queues."	1	1

What we really need is a way to remove NTLM headers after the authentication has succeeded.  Mike"	0	0

"Bertrand - nice work. This is a great idea and the patch looks good overall. Couple of points:  - Don't forget the Apache header on the new Errors class - Maybe do the grammar corrections on the counter error messages separately? Just so we keep the commits to a single issue each. - I'm not sure we need to retain the delegating ""formatValueList"" method in TestDriver. Something to discuss...  As for using Guava to do the string join - I know MRUnit used to have it as a dependency but this was removed in MRUNIT-50. Probably not worth bringing it back for such a simple method. "	1	1

One can extend FacetFields and provide his own DrillDownStream. I'll need to check about that one, but it looks like we can get rid of it too."	0	0

I ran without the security manager, so I did not get it set.

"{quote} I don't really know much about NamedSPILoader but I think what you're suggesting. How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName? {quote}  It needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!), but it works like Charset.forName(""ASCII"") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName, Codec.listAllCodecs, ...).  Have a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you ""register"" your classes in your jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.  So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""Whitespace"") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily, they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars), are automatically available this way.  I think Uwe mentioned this idea before, though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue :)  Just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable. On the other hand we shouldn't use anything overkill if its not the right fit... "	0	1

"bq. guess we need to supply a tool to rename sstables files if anyone is on longer names?  We probably don't need to do anything. I don't think anyone is really using names long enough for them to it the file system limit, the goal of limiting the names is just so to prevent this from happening but there will be no other assumption that the names are short from the code.  I also don't think anything will prevent rolling upgrades, do you had something in mind?

"Stefan   > the said method is not public since it returns *all* workspace names, regardless of user rights. please note that > the a session must only see/know about workspaces it is actually allowed to access.  I'm working on a garbage collector for the data store. The GC doesn't care about user rights, or, putting it another way, it must be able to access all workspaces. Ideally I'd like to use a SystemSession, but you can't get one outside RepositoryImpl or o.a.j.c package (i.e., getSystemSession(String) is package private, WorkspaceInfo is protected). I understand that these APIs shouldn't be public, but they're useful from within the core. In my case, for the GC. I'm very interested in using another way to walk every workspace, but this other way should guarantee that the repository won't shutdown during a walk operation. I'll check the solution Thomas said he'll be proposing, but in the mean time that is what I'm using. Still, I don't see why this APIs aren't public. Regards"	0	0

"Hello   Sure you are right here, I didn't make myself clear enough Im sorry.  As you (and RFC959) say, when we are sending the file we should transform to NVT-ASCII but not when we are receiving the file. In this second case, i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.  The sender converts the data from an internal character representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver will convert the data from the standard form to his own internal form.   Actually , according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII , for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.  So I don't know ... Any way, this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode.     "	0	-1

However, I don't think this patch should be accepted as-is :-) There is a LOT of duplicate code in my patch. I did this because I didn't want to mess with the QueryRunner code if everyone thought my idea was stupid.

I propose that we create a base or abstract class which both QueryRunner and AsyncQueryRunner extend. Thoughts? "	0	0

"Using nutch with solr has been a very demanding request  so it will be very useful when this makes into trunk. I have spend some time reviewing the patch  which I find quite elegant.  Some improvements to the patch would be - make NutchDocument implement VersionedWritable instead of writable, and delegate version checking to superclass - refactor getDetails() methods in HitDetailer to Searcher (it is not likely that a class would implement Searcher but not HitDetailer) - use Searcher, delete HitDetailer and SearchBean - Rename XXXBean classes so that they do not include ""bean"". (I think it is confusing to have bean objects that have non-trivial functionality) - refactor LuceneSearchBean.VERSION to RPCSearchBean - remove unrelated changes from the patch.(the changes in NGramProfile, HTMLLanguageParser,LanguageIdentifier,... correct me if i'm wrong)  As far as i can see, we do not need any metadata for Solr backend, and only need Store,Index and Vector options for lucene backend, so i think we can simplify NutchDocument#metadata. We may implement : {code} class FieldMeta { o.a.l.document.Field.Store store; o.a.l.document.Field.Index index; o.a.l.document.Field.TermVector tv; }  FieldMeta[] IndexingFilter.getFields();  class NutchDocument { ... private ArrayList<Field> fieldMeta; ... }  {code}  Or alternatively we may wish to keep add methods of NutchDocument compatible with o.a.l.document.Document, keeping the metadata up-to-date as we add new fields, using this info at LuceneWriter, but ignoring in SolrWriter. This will be slightly slower but the API will be much more intuitive. "	0	0

"1. My feeling is that ""if (file.lastModified() < now + ACCESS_TIME_RESOLUTION)"" is not necessary  since the lastModified value will already be truncated to the system resolution  but I do not think it is harmful.  2. I chose to throw exception only if file.canWrite, because I was trying to minimise the impact of the change. It's not clear to me whether setLastModified might work when !file.canWrite. However, it certainly must work (because of GC) if file.canWrite. I would consider moving the canWrite test outside of the setLastModified call, similar to getRecordIfStored, it just wasn't necessary to fix the immediate problem.  3. Well, not swallowed exactly, but caught and converted to failure return code (-1) e.g. see BLOBInDataStore.getSize. In any case, the javadoc for Property.getLength/getLengths documents -1 as a possible ""failure"" return code, so it had to be tested. I think if Property.getLength/getLengths throws an exception, that is already correctly handled.  Thanks for the quick response.  "	0	1

"Hi Manjula  I think your approach basically looks good. Please see my comments below.  1) I think this code  +        NetworkServerControl serverControl = null; +        int port = TestConfiguration.getCurrent().getPort(); +        String hostName = TestConfiguration.getCurrent().getHostName(); +        serverControl = new NetworkServerControl(InetAddress +                .getByName(hostName), port);// initialized for the shutdown.  could be replaced by a call to NetworkServerTestSetup.getNetworkServerControl()  2) +        try { +            serverControl.shutdown(); +        } catch (Exception e) { +            fail(""Unexpected exception"" + e.getMessage()); +            e.printStackTrace(); +        }  e.printStackTrace() won't ever be called, since it's placed right after a call to fail(). Anyway, I think it is better just to remove the try/catch/fail and let JUnit handle the exception itself.  3) I can't see that getNewPort() is used, so it's probably best to remove it.  4) It looks like most of the changes in TestConfiguration.java are reformatting/white-space changes. If you could post a new patch which only contained what's actually changed, it would be easier to review those changes."	1	1

"@Owen - I'm working on getting Harmony working on Hadoop at present. We're pretty close  and have workarounds for most issues but the trick is to fix the issues in such a way that we can create a patch with a resolution that works for all the JREs.  Yes, there are equivalent classes for both IBM Java and Harmony, so we could do something whereby it identifies the JRE and then loads the appropriate library, but I'm looking to see if there is a more extensible approach.  @Nicholas - Yes, Hadoop 0.20.x works just fine on IBM Java. I've submitted patches targeted for 0.20.3 - see HADOOP-6923 and HADOOP-6924 - that makes Hadoop 0.20.x work cross JRE.  The com.sun.security.auth classes were introduced with Hadoop 0.21"	0	0

TestHRegion is unorthodox -- intentionally -- in that it doesn't use inherit from HBaseClusterTestCase so it didn't pick up the changes made w/ mhbc.patch.  Hopefully its this anomaly that was responsible for the hang.  Attaching a patch that has TestHRegion do like the rest of the hbase (and hadoop dfs) tests shutting down the filesystem first and then the dfs cluster.	0	0

The cause is that the call to SpecificResponder.writeError in Responder.respond ultimately calls GenericData.resolveUnion which in turn calls GenericData.getSchemaName before the line where the UnresolvedUnionException gets thrown.	0	-1

"Hi Oliver   Thanks for catching this problem and for your suggested fix. We can go one step in simplifying the fix by removing the need for URI altogether if we use the getResourceAsStream() method of ClassLoader rather than getResource().

"Sumeet  we did it purposely because if the proxy services are dynamically loaded then we need to build those services at the runtime and redeploy them which is a little bit risky on a production environment. Also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup.  We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic), but I don't see any value there. If you could explain a bit about your exact requirement, I might be able to provide an alternative to this.  Thanks, Ruwan"	1	1
I added your tests and didn't see any failures against ActiveMQ.  However I did make a change anyway to StompFrame similar to you patch expect that I just used the DataInputStream's readFully method to ensure all the data gets pulled off the wire.	0	0
"bq. I assumed modules doesn't need to be self-contained like Lucene or Solr. I can fix that by enforcing tools' compilation in that macro... I'll do that. bq. Steve, will you double check again if everything works  Yes, everything works for me now, thanks!  bq. and commit this in?  Is there some reason why you can't do this?  IMO committers should commit their own work.  bq. I didn't put an entry into CHANGES so you'd have to add it if it qualifies at all to be mentioned there.  IMO this definitely warrants a CHANGES.txt entry.  This should also be backported to branch_3x.  bq. This reminds me of the ""infrastructure tools"" problem we had in Carrot2. We finally decided to simply have them as a stand-alone project living within the same repository space, with a stored, versioned binary artefact updated when tools had to be updated (rarely). This does version a binary file but you don't need to worry about recompiling things over and over.  +1 to do this for this and any other Lucene/Solr Ant tasks."	0	0

"> but I renamed a set of sstable files in data/ to the ""wrong"" version and it did not catch this at startup. I'm not sure what you mean. Which is the ""wrong"" version: the legacy version?  > (does it still ignore tmp files at startup?) I'll double check, but I assume so. I didn't change the check that removes tmp files, because it did it based on looking for TEMPFILE_MARKER anywhere in the file name, which should continue to work."	0	0

I think I also removed a few attrs that we didn't need to store... and downgraded skipOffset from long -> int (it's int on trunk)."	0	0
